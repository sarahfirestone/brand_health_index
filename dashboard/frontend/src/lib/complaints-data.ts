I have called them no less than three times on this matter and it's becoming unprofessional, offensive, and verging on illegal. I continue to receive notices and delinquencies that my account is XXXX days behind on payments ; however, I am currently enrolled in a debt repayment program that has sent all payments out on time and in line with the amount agreed to between InCharge Debt Solutions and TD Bank Retail Card Services . Looking at InCharge Debt Solutions records, payments have been sent XX/XX/25, XX/XX/25, and XX/XX/25 for the previously agreed upon total of XXXX XXXXXXXX. TD Bank continues to state that I am behind on my account and continues to either call or mail me regarding this matter.",

    narrative: "On XX/XX/XXXX, I walked into a TD Bank waited an hour to set up a new account. I deposited a large check. The funds were made available to me on XX/XX/XXXX in full. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the ATM to withdraw more money but my card was declined. I called the customer representative and the person who picked up the phone was rude and started yelling at me calling me a fraudster. The exchange was so vile that I hung up the phone. After composing myself, I called back and I was told that based on TD procedure, I had to wait XXXX business days for the funds to be available. I also received written communication to that effect. I came back to XXXX without my medical procedure. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I walked into a branch and was told that I didn't have all my names on my account to provide verification that the check was mine. I sent them the letter stating that I would be receiving the check which includes a phone number and address of the issuing party as well as ID that had all my names on it. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the bank and my funds were still not available. I was told that I was being put on an extended hold til XX/XX/XXXX. When I called the TD Customer service, I was told the only way to verify the check is to go back into TD Branch. I made the phone call after visiting the branch. When I sent an email to the TD Bank Branch President, I was told  There is no extended hold on your account. I advised you, the name on your profile had to be ammended. I expedited, which takes about 3 days. I also advised that once that is updated, then I will be able to have them remove the block. As of today, the name change has not been updated. Once it is, I will proceed with the process TD has in place to have the check updated. ''",

They then told me that my son card has been used even though Ive never received it. TD Bank claimed they did an investigation, but the bank never found out who activated my sons card. They concluded their investigation by saying that it was not fraud due to the fact the person who stole it stop using it after I placed the call that my card wasnt working due to insufficient funds.

They charged me an interest of XXXX dollar and a late fee of {$31.00}. I never got a reminder via email like i used to about this so i missed the date to pay the late payment fee and just kept adding addidtional late payment fees on top of the late payment fee that was already due creating a big debt for me. And all because they didn't send me reminder via email. I also talked to a td bank person via phone and they said that once we send out the money to the bank we will then pay the balance. Now i hear from another person. That once the transaction is posted thats when the balance has been paid. Oh and did i mention they locked me out of my account for 2 months so that i wouldn't be able to see my balance so i couldn'tdo anything about it?",

    narrative: "My father had passed away in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, a little less than a year ago. As the personal representative of the estate I had advised we would be keeping the vehicle. I spoke with the lien holder- TD Auto Finance , and I personally had been added to the loan, I am now the primary borrower due to my fathers death. I had advised them monthly payments would continue. I have since being added to the loan paid between XXXX and XXXX XXXX dollars approximately. I have spoken with the Massachusetts RMV regarding having the vehicle titled in my name, and was advised to have the lienholder send me this title directly to then take the title to the RMV with a list of documents in order to have the vehicle legally registered and titled in my name. The lienholder is refusing to send me this title as the loan has not yet been paid in full. They will only send the title to the RMV of Massachusetts, who is advising they will return the title to the lienholder as additional paperwork is not present, and as a result they are unable to make any updates. I have been in contact with the RMV of MA multiple times over the last 10 months with no other resolution aside from receiving the title and manually making these changes with them in person with all of the requested documents, including the title. As I have been in contact with the lienholder they have consistently refused to send this title to me directly despite having accepted the funds for payments since I have been added to the loan. The vehicle in question has sat in my driveway for well over a year while Ive dealt with this. Ive requested the title be sent to me multiple times and have been denied despite having provided proof of insurance, ( on a vehicle I can not drive ) the payments on a consistent basis, and multiple requests. I cant drive the car as its yet to be registered or titled in my name, but they have added me to the loan, and as a result I am obligated to make these payments or risk adverse credit reporting. This is essentially extortion like behavior. Either risk adverse credit reporting, and lose the x amount of funds Ive put into the vehicle since having been added to the loan, or pay off the entire amount in order for TD Auto Finance to send me the title directly for me to then make these changes without the need of the lien holder. I have provided TD auto finance with all documents requested in order for them to understand that my father has passed, and that I am under all legal aspects the executor of the estate. There is no other way to make these changes with the RMV, and as a result I feel extorted by this lien holder as I am unable to use , drive, register, or title this vehicle in my name despite being legally obligated to make these payments. This is an absolutely abhorrent business practice especially to someone whos lost a loved and close family member less than a year ago.",

I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX who told me he was the investigator and said he didn't have letters I sent to CEO a few months ago. I resent to him Certified mail and heard nohing I kept calling and finally reached him. He said he was passing it along to a different investigator and they would be in touch. Meanwhile my credit score keeps going down because everyone is lowering my credit limit ( which I am not using anyway ) so it looks like I am at a higher percentage of my limit. This is unethical and corrupt on the part of TD bank - I have been paying all my bills on time - check no late payments/ 100 % paying on time and never late. All my card limits are being lowered because of what TD bank has done to me. They never really investigated anything though they were given more than enough info. If I have a XXXX because of them I will leave instructions that my heirs should sue them for putting me in the grave. This is not a joke. a year and XXXX ago my credit score was XXXX and this am XXXX - I am beside myself with anger - how can a bank not investigate. They have turned over nothing to me, They didn't cooperate with the Sherrif dept either I want them to remove the remarks on my credit score NOW",

    narrative: "I opened a secure credit card with td in XXXX. I was informed that the secure credit card would automatically take the funds from a savings account linked to it to satisfy a balance if there was any when the account was created. When the credit card was dispersed I never activated the card and I never used it. WhenI logged into my online platform I was not able to see the card either. I was contacted by td about a balance sometime in XXXX and eas informed the account was closed as a result. I went in branch and informed them I never used the card or activated it so there could not have been a balance. I logged in showing them the card did not even display on my online platform. Td then realized their error and explained they had created a separate account when they issued the credit card so I was not able to see the credit card on my end nor was I informed of any annual fee, nor could I because of Td 's mistake see that an annual fee was due. The bank representative after acknowledging the mistake of the bank had them reverse the late fees and they only took the XXXX dollar annual fee as a payment. They also merged the profiles so I could then see the credit card and because they had closed that card already they issued me another credit card the same secured td cash type again. I have since realized however td has been displaying this account as a delinquent account of XXXX  days or XXXX  days despite reversing the charges and acknowledging i was not at fault. I have reached out to td several times by call and I have also sent a letter in XX/XX/XXXX asking them to rectify the issue by fixing reporting the account as delinquent. To date I have not received a response from them. This has resulted in my credit report being flagged by lenders who have not been willing to extend credit to me referencing this account and also has resulted in my not being able to find housing in certain areas. Td has refused to fix the issue when I have spoken to their credit card department or supervisors of this department.",

On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I contacted their supervisor XXXX. she promised to contact me the next day. She never did. I tried to call XXXX XXXX, who was Cced on the emails, her number is not in service. The telephone number for XXXX is also not in service. The general XXXX  customer service could not help and insisted everyone was in all-day meetings. I had no access to my new account and could not get any help. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I tried to log on and continually got error messages. I called customer service again and was told my XXXX  was  in-active '' and only XXXX could help. She remained on vacation. I have spent more than 5 hours on the phone trying to get a resolution. Now I can not access any of my accounts and conduct my business. I have bills to pay and payments to be received. These people NEVER informed me that my account was to be made in-active, nor did they have the right to tamper with my account. The incompetence, lack of professionalism, lack of accountability and sheer stupidity defy logic. I have XXXX accounts and at this stage switching banks would cause further disruption to my business.

Furthermore, portions of the delinquency period overlap with the XXXX pandemic, during which the CARES Act ( Section XXXX ) required creditors to report accounts in a manner consistent with any accommodations or relief provided.

I requested with forms my skipped payments be put into the end of loan and to to this date while I have returned all documentation immediately after it was sent to me and they have acknowledged receipt XX/XX/XXXX, the forberance and modification are still open. This process was supposed to take 30 days and we are not at 11 months. I have contacted them every few weeks but all I get is a customer service rep with no resolve. The main issue beyond thus still being open is they have put derogatory marks on my credit for the past 5 months. Each one states i am 90 to 120 dats late but there was a 4 month forberance so we were not late. I have disputed in credit and they respond that the marks stand. They don't care at all I have no supervisor or anyone of authroity to help. Its unbelievable.",

She always gets a receipt for the transaction, but this time it read  error '' and something along the lines of going inside the bank to get help with that. When she went inside, they couldn't give her access to that because it was my account. I then called customer service from out the country and tried resolving that issue. The lady had said that she saw the {$600.00} and {$400.00} deposit and that it was pending. I disputed the atm transaction after the issue was supposedly  resolved '' on their end and they minused the money from my account. TD bank got back to me and said  there was no extra money found in the ATM at the end of that day ''. I then proceeded to file another dispute for them to check the cameras because I need my {$1000.00} dollars. They did the same thing, added money temporarily then took it back.",

    narrative: "The company refuses to remove fraudulent charges that I reported on my account. They claim that I made the charges but when I asked them to provide authentic documentation to prove I was responsible they refused. I spoke with multiple representatives, the investigator, and a supervisor but no one was willing to help and continued to blame me for charges I did not complete. My last straw was when the supervisor told me I was supposed to receive a letter to initial the charges I did not do. I informed her I did not and she said she would send it again, she told me I had to send supporting documents such as a police report, but I didnt have a police report because I didnt know I had to file a police report because it clearly states in their terms and conditions that if I notice unauthorized charges on my account I have to contact them. It doesnt say I need to file police report once I notice the card missing. Anyway I followed all the directions on the letter including sending a copy of my drivers license and sent it to them. The letter also had no mention of sending support documents. After they received it I called them and they told me to call back in 7-10 business. I did call back and the representative basically told me that they didnt do anything with the letter, in a sense the letter was just used to quiet me for some time and waste my time. I told her I wanted to speak with the investigator to see why nothing was done with the letter and she told me he would call me back in 24-48 hours and I never received that call back. So because of there refusal to communicate with me and them discriminating me my treating my case differently than others by asking more of me than what was requested my the letter I have no choice but to file a complaint. Also, during this time they have done everything to ruin my credit score by reporting late payments, late fees, and interest charges despite there being an active appeal to their decision. Per their terms and conditions I am not responsible for fraud charges on my account so unless an evidence document is provided for every single transaction that proves I did those charges, I will not be paying anything.",

    narrative: "On XX/XX/XXXX ( approximately ) I received an alert from my credit monitoring program that my Heloc balance spiked. Logged into my TD account to see my Heloc balance at XXXX or so XXXX called TD banks fraud line and went through the process to get it resolved. Being so close to the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I was nervous that the bank wouldnt do anything about it until after the holiday but was assured it was being taken care of. I spent hours of time going to branches signing affidavits and hours on the phone through the fraud process and thought it was over. I received letters ASSURING me that it was taken care of. In the past 2 months my credit has been destroyed by this process and I found out today that the ACTUAL problem was that TD bank screwed up. They mistook a 1 for a 7 or something and took the money from MY account instead of the correct account. During the fraud process TD closed my Heloc and reopened it under a different account number in case it was fraud. In the process they must have deposited the money that was taken from my account to the old account, not the new one so in the end I mistakenly had a balance of XXXX or so and it looked like I was negligent because I wasnt paying it off. NONE OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS ANY OF MY DOING somehow Im the ONLY one suffering from all the BS that TD created I think Im owed more than an apology. But, AT THE VERY LEAST AN APOLOGY. I was told Id probably have to wait 30-60 days to see results on this. Ive since spent hours on the phone with both TD bank and XXXX to try to salvage my credit score. Make this right please. Should have never happened..",

I have received my XXXX card from expedited shipping and have not received my TD bank card yet! My direct deposit was deposited into my TD account around XXXX on XX/XX/year>. As previous stated I do not have my debit card for TD so I have zelleing money in/out of my TD to XXXX  or vice versa. this attempt for {$970.00} has not been first time moving money out of my account through XXXX specifically to XXXX. I got an email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX saying my XXXX  account has been suspended. Another email at XXXX saying that Your Send Money with XXXX profile is on hold. When I called at XXXX on Wednesday they werent able to verify me through a verification codes so I answered questions about my identity and transactions that were posted in the account. She said she couldnt verify me.. and I had to go to a branch. I let the lady know I do not have a state ID. Im waiting on my birth certificate to get a new one. She then said I can go with a SSN or a birth certificate. I went down there to the branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX MD and the man said He needed an ID. So her information was false and Im upset I cant remember her name. When I left I called again around XXXX and a nice man named XXXX actually helped and had my transferred to the fraud department. Once I was transferred to fraud department the lady put it in the request. The request was put around XXXX. She said to try logging back in at XXXX. I tried and tried. I was still locked out. I called again around XXXX and was transferred to the XXXX XXXX department XXXX He said newer accounts can take anywhere from XXXX hours. That information was also not told to me from the fraud department. I called later on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. Explained the situation she said that I had to wait a full business day. So it went from two hours, to XXXX hours, to now waiting a business day. Now its XX/XX/XXXX and I spoke to somebody at XXXX because now XXXX hours have passed. She says nobody has looked at the ticket. She said shes putting in another ticket and usually this type of matter only takes XXXX hours. She now there a total of XXXX tickets put in and Im still locked out of my XXXX account. This is absolutely XXXX ridiculous. When I do get back in trust and believe TD will never see another direct deposit or anything of the sort. The most convenient bank is straight BS. In the time frame out 2 days I have spoken to one person at a branch and XXXX representatives over the phone and have gotten no answers but the run around and still locked out of my account.",

I was awoken by phone, alerting me to my account being used so I immediately locked my debit card, which I never use anyway, but that was the only thing I knew to do and so I went to my local branch immediately the next day, and they said there was a pending charge for {$30.00} from an auto pay that I had set up with one of my credit cards that I had already contacted and asked to stop drafting the auto pay .. unfortunately, they drafted it anyway and so then the second time I still had a pending transaction I pleaded with them to let me pay the transaction and close the account and they refused so I closed my savings account because they told me they could not protect my money, so I said Id like it all in a cashiers check please, but they said they still couldnt close the checking account so I took the cashiers check for my savings and am still trying to close the checking account. And everyone that works in that branch is horribly rude and exude zero compassion. So they refused toclose the account even with the fraudulent activity. Therefore, the pending charges they were speaking of that were keeping me from closing the account. Were late fees on fraudulent charges! How does that make sense? Its the worst experience Ive ever had in a business in my life. I went back a second time, a third time, a fourth time, a fifth time, and the sixth time will be today.",

The only related written document I received was a HELOC Modification Agreement, dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated that my Annual Percentage Rate would be .75 % below the current Prime Rate.
