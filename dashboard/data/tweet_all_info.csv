2025-10-01 19:38:36+00:00,"Should I break my mortgage at 5.25% to switch to 3.94% variable?

Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice on my mortgage situation for an investment condo.

* Current balance: **$572,000**
* Current rate: **5.25% fixed**
* Term renewal date: **Feb 1, 2027**
* Option: Break now (penalty \~$7,500) and switch to **variable at 3.94 %** with TD (Prime minus 0.91%)

If I stay at 5.25%, my payments are about **$3,219/month**.  
If I switch, payments drop to around **$2,797/month** — so about **$422 less per month**.

I ran the numbers:

* By Feb 2027, I’d pay about **$700 more overall** (I save money in monthly payments but I have to pay a penalty), but I’d also owe about**$3,200 less on the principal**.  So net I'm saving about $2500.
* The only risk is if interest rates go up more than 0.25% from where they are now (2.5% in October 2025), I could lose money.

I’m leaning toward paying the penalty now, enjoy lower payments, given it seems rates don't look to be going up over the next 16 months.

Wondering if others have thoughts.

Thanks in advance!",neutral,0,0.11292969435453415,0.8459067940711975,0.04116358980536461

Hi all, I’m looking at the TD Easy Trade bonus where they match up to $2,500 if you transfer $25,000 in 6 months, with a $5,000 monthly limit.

My plan is to move $25,000 from my BMO account to Wealthsimple (in a TFSA) then each month transfer $5,000 back to BMO, where it’s set to automatically deposit into my TD Easy Trade account.Would this strategy qualify for the full bonus? Or does cycling the money back to BMO and then into TD each month disqualify or cause issues with the promo?Thanks for any insights!

Figured it makes more sense to have some money accruing in a TFSA instead of just waiting to be transfered. 

Are there any penalties for withdrawing from TFSA? I have plenty of contribution room.

I (21) Have been working a flexible job since I was 18, I make around 32k a year which is hardly enough to get by with the cost of living.

I'm simultaneously completing uni as a full time student, and want to pursue higher education when I'm done my bachelor's degree. However, it is difficult to get by attending school 4 days a week and cramming my full time hours into 3 days, all while I live paycheque to paycheque.

I was wondering if the student loans I've accumulated (11k)— which I will not be dipping into due to being able to cover my education with grants + a bit of my own pay— would be a good idea to put into some sort of account or investing account.

I come from a low-income family, raised by a single parent so I genuinely have no idea what it means to have financial literacy, and have never really had an adult in my life who good sufficiently guide me in regards to finances. All I know is having a budget that gets me from month to month without going into debt.

I have a BMO credit card as well that just does cashback, I don't carry a balance & last time I checked my credit score was around 760.

2. Aeroplan points will be collected for every dollar I spend.

 * Operating charges

 * Compensation received from third parties (trailing commissions)

If I add the two amounts and divide by the total value of my portfolio, it comes to 1.27%. BUT the thing is, my portfolio is made up of mutual funds. To know the total fees I pay per year, do I ALSO have to add the management fee (MER) of my mutual funds, or is the MER of the mutual funds already included in the amounts mentioned above?

I think it’s around CA$15000.

Hi! I'm newly 18 and would like to build credit history but i honestly don't know how to go about it. I have accounts at cibc and at td, and i have no income (job hunting is extremely hard ive been looking) thus i'm considering getting a student card of some kind. i want experience in managing credit and maybe making small purchases using a credit card. i have a good amount of money saved and will be functioning on ""charge only how much i could've feasibly paid with my debit"" mindset so i'm not gonna splurge or smth.

i don't entirely know where to start? i definitely want a no annual fee card but in terms of other perks i don't really know what i want? i've looked into TD's cards and CIBC's cards and i don't know if i really NEED awards or cashback (could be nice but i don't travel enough to make aero points worth it and i don't buy groceries since i live at home, the most i've gotten is that td awards lets you save on amazon purchases which i do make) but having a card that's just a basic card isn't on those websites, and i've looked on reddit around different posts and they all say you can just borrow from a bank that's not yours but the thing is i'd like to be able to actually get to those banks in person and i don't live near a tangerine for example (i'm closer to the major banks). i'd rather go with something already familiar to me tbh.

was considering RBC but have heard bad things about their cards historically.

In the past few years, a lot of companies like Wealthsimple, Webull, even banks like TD have offered very high bonuses to transfer accounts (such as TFSAs, RRSP, unregistered).

With such high customer acquisition costs, how can they make that back? The best I can tell is with very high foreign exchange fees (often 1-3% of the trade), which will quickly offset the said bonuses. On the other hand, brokers like Interactive Brokers will give you interbank rates for a flat fee of around $3 but don't have generous customer acquisition incentives.

2025-10-07 12:41:42+00:00,"Debt Consolidation Strategy

I am looking for some advice on how to tackle CC Debt that has gotten away from me a bit over the last year, compounded by a period of unemployment (strike) this past summer. 

Currently have 11.5k on a credit card, which is my biggest concern. 

Other debts I have include a car loan (35k, 7%), student loan (18k) and mortgage (535k, about 3k/month) 

All of these debts, with the exception of the mortgage, are in my name only. My wife is on the mortgage. 

Although the car is in my name, the expense is shared, and comes out of our joint account. The student loan, and credit card are my financial responsibilities. 

I take home 1250 after taxes each week, however 60% of that is deposited to our shared account, for shared household expenses (bills, grocery, mortgage, car, etc) 

This leaves me about 2k per month for my own expenses. 

My student loan costs $290/month, my phone $60, life insurance $75, subscriptions, $20 and fuel about $100/month (my portion…we drive a lot) 

I am concerned about the interest on my CC with the large balance, so I did try and get a personal LOC with my primary bank (TD) to try and use this to consolidate but didn’t qualify for anything based on my debt to income ratio. I do have a LOC with my secondary bank (CIBC) for 5k that is currently unused. I was hoping to get a 10k LOC with TD as my expenses come out of my TD account, and it would be easier to pay the LOC with funds deposited to my TD account. 

Is the play to max out my CIBC LOC to pay off my CC, and then aggressively pay off the LOC until clear, while still making min payments on the CC, and then repeat? 

Any other options I could consider?",negative,-1,0.5349999070167542,0.443255752325058,0.02174435555934906

Maybe this isn't the right question to ask but, I need to think something through.  
  
Scenario: I have some big spending coming up.   
  
\~$25,000 I will use a CC to pay off a loan (no fee for using CC), that I will then immediately pay off with a HELOC (intro 1.99%).  
\~$10,000 in materials for a bathroom renovation  
\~$5,000 before 12/31 on season ticket payment plans  
  
With that in mind I would ""like"" to spend $49,780 on my Chase United Quest card to get me to the $40k in spend to earn 2 free economy upgrade passes plus also enough PQP to get me Silver status for 2026. Arguably this isn't worth it.  
  
I also hold:  
1. Capital One Venture X that's at $27,974 YTD spend. Not sure what benefits exist if I spend more other than accumulating more CapOne points.  
2. P2 has a Chase United Quest card that hasn't hit $20k spend yet (to earn the 10,000 reward miles that must be used within a year)  
3. Chase Disney Visa (not spending on this)  
4. Amazon Visa (not spending on this other than Amazon purchases)  
5. Citi Professional (Old Card - limited benefits, don't use except for at Yankee Stadium for MasterCard deals)  
6. Citi Costco Visa (spend at Costco, Restaurants, and some other misc. that gets additional % cashback on it)  
7. DiscoverIT (Occasionally spend if the quarterly categories align)  
8. Citi Simplicity Card (don't spend on this)  
9. AmEx Blue Cash (older version - spend on groceries and pharmacy only)  
10. Marriott Bonvoy (rarely spend on this even if i stay at marriotts)  
11. Chase United Gateway (recently downgraded Explorer card since it's not beneficial to pay AF now that I have Quest card)  
12. TD Bank (not spending)

13. Wells Fargo (not spending)    
  
  
If i look at my 5/24, i have Wells Fargo (4/2024), TD Bank (4/2024), and Chase Quest (8/24) Do my wife's cards opened in the past few years count against my 5/24 if i am an AU on the card? if yes, then she has TD (3/24), and Chase Quest (8/24)  So i'm either sitting at 3 or 5, with all dropping off in the next 7-12 months.   I guess I'm seeking advice on should I find a good SUB (maybe finally start the 10xTravel process with the Chase card), or should I target hitting spend thresholds on any of my current cards (namely, Quest or Venture X as I don't think the others have any good benefits).

I just got very frustrated when TD wanted to charge me $9.99 commission on a tiny ETF purchase. Did some googling and found out that wealthsimple is basically better in every way (except for maybe CDIC protection). Chequing account that earns interest, 0% FX fee/2% cash back credit card, no commissions on trades. I don't need a physical branch and only use it when TD makes me for stupid reasons. 

My wife and I have a combined decent amount (enough to qualify for wealth simple crediting our fees and considering us premium customers) across our TFSA/RRSP/chequing at TD (no mortgage), but I want to know if anyone has gone through a similar process and how big of a pain it was.

Hello! I have been seeing posts here and I think its now my time to get some advice. I recently started a full time job and finally crossed the 6-figure mark. As a 26 year old this is obviously a significant job for me an I want to make sure I get the maximum value from my bank and credit card. Previously I was with Scotiabank student advantage plus plan with a scene visa credit card. Now this credit card had $1000 which was fine back then but I want to increase it obviously. They say only way to increase is to change to new plan etc. This made me thinking, I don't feel like I don't get any value or benefits of this credit card at all.

I started looking at credit cards and found the TD Aeroplan card which seems great considering you earn aeroplan points and as AC is in star alliance I can use that in other airlines as well.

2025-10-08 20:17:47+00:00,"Expedia for TD Points Reversed — Charged $341 for a Flight I Didn’t Cancel. What Should I Do?

Hey folks — need some advice on how to deal with TD Bank or Expedia for TD.

On **May 19, 2025**, I booked a multi-leg international flight through **Expedia for TD**.  
Total cost: **$2,433.20**  
I redeemed **$341 worth of TD Rewards Points** during checkout (used at the 0.5¢/point travel value).

All good. Flight’s booked. I saw the $341 redemption show up in my credit card statement.  
No issues… until recently.



# The problem:

�� The **airlines changed my itinerary** a few times (not cancelled — just modified).  
�� I didn’t request any changes or cancellations.  
�� Despite this, I was suddenly **charged $341** with a line called **“TD Points Reversal”**  
�� The $341 in points was refunded back to my TD Rewards account, but...  
�� Now, if I try to redeem them again (say, for cash back or bill credit), they’re only worth **0.25¢/point** — not the travel value I originally used.



# So now I’m stuck with:

✅ An active flight  
❌ No points applied to it anymore  
❌ A surprise $341 charge  
❌ Points that are now only worth half their original value



I haven’t contacted TD yet because I wanted to know if anyone else has dealt with this — or if you have advice on **who to call**, **what to say**, or **how to get them to re-apply the points** at the original value.

Should I be contacting TD directly or Expedia for TD? Any tips on phrasing or escalation?

Hey everyone, I'm hoping the experts here can help cut through the analysis paralysis I'm having with credit cards.

I've banked with Scotiabank for years and have been using their Scene+ Visa card out of habit. We basically just cash out the points for movies/cash back. I've finally started looking into properly using points for travel, and I'm completely overwhelmed by the options.

Our Situation:

· Bank: Scotiabank (but not married to them if there's a better option).
· Current Card: Scotiabank Scene+ Visa.
· Goal: Start building points specifically for travel (flights, hotels). We don't travel much now but want to start.
· Monthly Spend (on cards):
  · Groceries & Dining: ~$3,000
  · Gas: ~$1,000
  · Recurring Bills (utilities, phone, etc.): ~$1,000
  · Total: ~$6,000 (This does NOT include mortgage, insurance, etc.)

The Question:
What is my best move to start? Should I stick with the Scotiabank ecosystem and upgrade to one of their premium cards (like the Gold Amex or Passport Visa), or is there a clearly better option for our spending profile elsewhere (like AMEX Cobalt or a TD/CIBC Aeroplan card)?

I'm looking for the ""next step"" card to really kickstart our travel points. Any guidance or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated!",neutral,0,0.2668796181678772,0.6412903666496277,0.09182995557785034

I went to TD and after they rep told me verbally they can do a joint card and ""opened"" one. She called me at home and told me they actually dont do that but once my card comes ""i can call and add my partner"". This is not want I want.

Hello, I am currently in the process of trying to de-couple myself from TD and moving to a credit union/wealthsimple set up. I have mostly cash in my TD direct Investing now with the only holding a GIC maturing in 2027. The credit union said they can't handle the GIC as they only hold their own I guess. I thought maybe I could move it to a TD easy trade account but found out you cant have a GIC in there. It will pay out about 1k profit at the end (a decent amount of money for me), but a lot of that will get eaten up by maintenance fees once I pull the cash out of the Direct Investing ACCT (currently being waived with just over 15k in there). Was wondering if anyone on here knew of another way to transfer a GIC to somewhere without fees? Right now it seems my options are: cash it out and lose the gains, keep it in there and have the maintenance fee eat up a good chunk of the profit, or the person at TD said if you have 100$ deposits set up monthly the maintenance fee gets waived (was thinking I could invest that but then remembered the stupid commission fees)...

Title:
Returned an AT&T financed phone after paying it off — now fighting to get my refund back from AT&T

Post:
Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share my situation and see if anyone else has gone through this or can offer advice.

I bought a phone through AT&T but actually purchased it at Apple. The phone was financed through AT&T, and I paid off the full installment amount (around $654). I made a down payment at Apple when buying it.

After paying it off, I decided to return the phone to Apple (I did this just yesterday, within AT&T’s 14-day return window). Apple gave me back my down payment immediately, but I haven’t heard anything yet about the $654 I paid off to AT&T.

When I called AT&T (611), the rep told me in a recorded call that I would get the payoff amount refunded back to my original form of payment once the device was returned. But now, I’m stuck waiting, and it’s not showing as returned in AT&T’s system yet.

I’ve already disputed the charge with TD Bank (my credit card issuer) and emailed AT&T’s Office of the President about it, but I’m nervous about whether I’ll actually get my money back.

Has anyone been through something like this? How long did it take for AT&T to process the return and refund? Did you have to escalate a lot? Any tips on what else I should do?

Thanks in advance!

I’m using Tangerine as my relay station to transfer larger amount of funds between banks that don’t provide external account linking.

Now my funds are stuck. This is the first time I’m pulling money from RBC. Is this an RBC thing?

2025-10-10 15:35:01+00:00,"Sharing TD insurance auto claim ordeal - HELP

I have a no fault claim going on with TD insurance. I was informed vehicle is non-repairable. Offered a settlement amount. I reply with not accepting the and asking how they came up with that amount. Receive no reply for 1.5 days. Now claim status show resolved on Myinsurance app. Have written back and waiting for reply.

Points to notice :

1.On initial evaluation in repair shop i was informed my car is drivable. Can I keep driving it while claim gets processed (its shows closed now technically but I was still talking) even though its going to non-repairable status. Insurance on app is still active. Damage is on bumper and quarter panel , nothing structural.

2. I happen to share my signed registration copy before even an settlement amount was offered. Will it go against me ?

3.I have realized that I have a better package on my car than mentioned in spec sheet I agreed to. Power windows and cruise control were not included.

4. Previously, my insurance policy was cancelled and reinstated twice in 6 months as error was not on my part.  Once they had sent my registered letter to a wrong/incomplete address and shown proof of delivery with my forged signatures, done by their delivery partner ICS couriers.  Upon one month of fighting it, they apologized and reinstated it retrospectively and took away any negative history. I want to fight this forgery legally. Kindly help.

2025-10-11 01:10:39+00:00,"Got a job. Want to maximize gain over long-term with no to low risk. Advice please!

I'm in my mid 20s and work full-time, minimum wage, with low monthly spending. I have minimal investing experience. I don't really know what I'm doing, but have a couple months of emergency money saved up thats sitting in my checking account. I'm going to be meeting a financial planner soon at my TD bank branch and want to go in with some know-how.

**My goal:**  
I want to invest most of my additional income into something long-term, reliable, and safe, preferably with a return rate that at least beats inflation if not better.

**My idea:**  
I have several thousands of dollars of TFSA contribution room. I'm going to invest majority of every pay I get from my job (min. wage) into ETFs in the TFSA through TD bank. I am not sure yet if they even offer ETFs, and if they do, what options should I be choosing, and if they have fees/commissions/rates that would still be worth it.

**Where should I be investing?** In terms of net profit after fees/deductions, is TD Bank good to use for investing, or is there something better (e.g. WealthSimple, or another bank)?

**What should I invest in?** Are ETFs the best option, or should I be investing in a Mutual Fund, GIC, stocks, or something else? Or a mixed ratio of everything?

Any general advice is appreciated. What do you think I should do?",neutral,0,0.025678452104330063,0.49192187190055847,0.4823996126651764

Know absolutely nothing about finance - had everything in my checking until now.

I’ve been trying to figure out what the best HISA would be to keep emergency fund in but I think I’m getting more confused. 

I’m not the most financially literate and I really don’t have a lot of savings, but I don’t like only having 0.01% interest on the little money I do have. 

Here’s my situation; 
•Opened tfsa and direct investing with TD this year. Only ever banked with TD, but they don’t have any good hisa options. 
•Currently I have less than 5k in chequing and everyday savings (really only cause I’ve been spending over my means…. But could save a lot more with intention) 
•I am investing a bit with direct investing account 
•I have ~30K car loan that’s easy for me to pay and I typically add extra payments monthly (also where extra money goes)
•I make roughly 4-5K monthly 

Do I HAVE to shop around regularly for promos on HISA? Is there a safe and stable bank to keep my emergency fund in and not have to worry about plummeting interest rates? 

And, since I have years of contribution room in my tfsa, how should I be using that for savings vs investing ? 

I should have way more saved than I do with my salary. I really need to manage my money and I think taking advantage of interest is a simple start.

Hello everyone, 

I apologize as this may become somewhat of a long post depending on how much context I put into it. 

I’m in my late 20’s, male, and currently invest through Wealthsimple and TD investment accounts. 

I started investing young through TD, and I currently have a CAD & USD TFSA, and CAD & USD RSP’s. All of these accounts are self directed and amount to ~110k CAD. 

At the beginning of 2021 I started dollar cost averaging into VFV using Wealthsimple as they didn’t have a fee for CAD securities. I’ve currently grown my Wealthsimple account to 24k CAD with a FHSA maxed in Wealthsimple as well. 

For a LONG time now I’ve had thoughts of transferring all of my TD investing accounts over to Wealthsimple. The reason for doing this is for the automatic dividend reinvestments. I feel as if I’m losing out on a decent amount of the “snowball effect” as I’m earning ~1800CAD in dividends annually in my TD accounts right now. 

If you were me, would you transfer all of your accounts over? If you wouldn’t, why?

2025-10-15 22:04:20+00:00,"Regarding TD Balance Transfer Offer & Negative Credit Card Balances

Hello, 

I was hoping someone might have some insight or experience regarding doing a balance transfer to a credit card and leaving it with a negative credit balance. 

I was offered a promotional BT rate of 0% on my TD credit card with a 2% fee and which currently has a $0 balance and a $28,000 available limit. I wanted to use this to move over all of my outstanding debt that is currently accruing 8%+ interest. 

My current situation: 
$10,000 balance CIBC LOC ($10,000 limit)
$1,000 balance MBNA credit card ($5,000 limit)
$0 balance CIBC Credit Card ($6,500 limit)

The problem is TD won't allow me to balance transfer over balances from anything other than a non-TD credit card. MBNA apparently counts as a TD card since they are owned by them. Lines of credits aren't accepted (according to the rep I spoke to). Other BT offers in the past allowed me to just send the cash to my chequing account and use it to pay off whatever.

The potential workaround - do a balance transfer of $12,000 to my CIBC credit card leaving it with a negative balance of $12,000 and doing a negative balance transfer for that amount to my CIBC chequing account or doing ATM withdrawals to get the cash and use it to pay off the LOC & MBNA. 

One TD rep I spoke to said the balance transfer would not go through and another one I was transferred to said that it would go through and I would have a credit balance on my non-TD credit card. Before going through with it I thought I would post here to see if I'm missing anything or potential drawbacks I would have doing this...

Thanks in advance.",neutral,0,0.3496035635471344,0.6206045746803284,0.02979186177253723

2025-10-17 12:41:08+00:00,"TFSA transfer question

Have an odd one.  I've been consolidating my investments into TD Direct trading.  It was initially started due to my employer matched RRSP being ended, so I thought id move everything to one spot.  As part of this move, I had TD transfer my TD TFSAs and RRSPs as well.  Everything went well with the transfer except for the TFSA.  I have a mix of GICs and mutual funds.  The GICs arrived fine, but when the mutual funds arrived, things went odd.  
  
I placed a sell order as soon as I saw them in my account.  The initial sell was cancelled for some reason, possibly the transfer hadnt settled or something like that.  I waited a day and initiated a new sell order. About 2hrs after that some TD system initiated a switch order to change the fund. I asked support what that was about, and was told that it was due to the type of fund I had wasnt supported by direct trading, so the system was trying to move it to the equivalent direct investment supported fund.  In any case, it was supposed to be a moot point, as whichever trade was processed first would automatically cancel the other one.  The odd bit is sometime during this process, the system seems to have re-done the transfer from easyweb to direct investing, essentially doubling the amount I had in there.
  
I assumed this was just a display bug due to the two conflicting orders in, but once things settled, I was left with the cash value of the doubled amount.  As much as I'd like to keep the extra money, I spoke with support and they're supposed to be looking into it to sort things.

I’m trying to consolidate my FHSA accounts (each ~8000) from Wealthsimple plus TD direct investing to all in Wealthsimple to avoid any commission fees from TD. I know that TD charges transfer out fees and WS only reimburses over 25k, and also doesn’t charge transfer out fees. I also have checked other online brokerages like qtrade, quest trade, but they also appear to charge transfer out fees. 

Does anyone know of any other brokerage or creative pathway where I can get my TD account out of TD  and into WS without being charged 150$? I theoretically could transfer my WS account to TD to boost the amount to ~16k in case that might meet the threshold for any promotion or transfer fee reimbursement policy…

My only other idea is to wait till next year, boost my entire FHSA value to ~24000 (assuming the contribution limit is hopefully 8k again), and then wait for enough of a return to hit the 25k mark and then transfer to WS. This might require taking on more risk however as those accounts are in zero risk investment vehicles just matching inflation basically right now.",neutral,0,0.08011224865913391,0.8608800172805786,0.059007663279771805

Well, I have been waiting a few months for Wealthsimple to contact me and I am getting frustrated and I’m ready to give up on them.

2025-10-20 18:19:46+00:00,"Weird Car Situation and Debate, Need Advice

This is a long one, but I really need some advice here.

Profile of us and our vehicle: I have a 2007 Honda Accord with about 176000kms on it.  Nothing mechanically wrong with this car at all, we actively maintain the vehicle with regular oil changes. I replaced the front bumper with a cheapo aftermarket bumper about a year ago after I cracked the original bumper - this is the only body damage. When I purchased it in 2018 with 90000kms on it for 8k cash, I intended to have and drive this car forever. It was a private sale, I've never purchased a car from a dealership before, I've never had an auto loan or dealt with anything like that before. This is the only vehicle my husband and I own. We also purchased our first home for the first time ever in March of this year. He works from home full time, I commute to work 2 days a week via bus / LRT here in Edmonton. The car is for getting groceries, visiting my parents in the country, seeing friends, getting to guitar classes, all that good stuff. We just got married this year, and would like to have a child next year. Household income before tax is about 160k (this will be going up to 170k shortly). We currently have 18k saved up to put into finishing our basement.

What happened: in November 2024, we were living in a rental duplex, and the garage of that unit caught on fire. Our vehicle was in the garage during the fire. Only the roof of our side of the garage caught on fire, and the other unit's side completely burned down. The fire detective at that time told us to not claim any fire damage to our vehicle if there was no damage - and at that time, it did seem as though there was no damage and that we got off scot free. We immediately had an oil change and filter change, we cleaned all the upholstery, and there was no lingering smoke smell or anything. We have driven the vehicle as usual every day since then. Fast forward to September 1st of 2025, when the passenger side window randomly exploded. We thought this was a freak incident and didn't relate it to the fire, until this last weekend (October 18th) when our moonroof randomly exploded. We have also very recently (September) replaced the windshield as well, due to a crack in the top part of the windshield, which we thought was due to a rock chip, but we now think might be fire related. We recieved a quote from Crystal Glass to replace the moonroof for $1200 all in. But now we are worried that we might need to replace the remaining windnows (front passenger side, both back door windows, and the back window). We are waiting to talk to Crystal Glass to see if they can test the remaining winsdows to see if they are compromised and need replacing. If they are unable to test, then we will likely roll the dice and continue to drive without replacing them (this is probably a bad idea considering we've lost 3 windows in about 1.5 months, and winter is coming).

What should we do: I basically need advice from the group on whether it's worth it to replace all the windows with the upfront cost to us (this damage is not covered by our basic car insurance or the renter's insurance we had at the time of the fire), whether we should roll the dice persay and just replace the moonroof and see if the other windows explode. Or, if we should purchase a new vehicle. I don't think that we can sell this vehicle due to the fire situation even after replacing the moonroof (but advice is appreciated). We had a long term plan of purchasing a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek (my dream vehicle) and having 2 family vehicles. But the condition we had for getting that vehicle was me saving up another 10k to put down, and I haven't yet met that condition (essentially I just spent that 10k on our wedding in September and starting up that savings from scratch, I have about 12k in investments otherwise that I wont pull from, husband has about 40k in investments that won't be pulled from, and then we have the 18k basement fund). We would have to take from our 18k basement fund to put 10k down on the car, and finance the rest. I have never gotten financing for a vehicle before, so I don't know if I should get a loan from TD or get financing from Subaru directly for the remaining 10k that would be owed on this 20k vehicle (advice is desperately wanted on this!!!) of if the Subaru dealership would even offer that. I would want to pay off the remaining 10k aggressively in 1 year.

To boil it down: should we pre-emptively replace all the windows at a personal cost on our 2007 Honda Accord with no mechanical issues and continue to save towards a newer vehicle? Should we roll the dice and just replace the currently broken moonroof at a personal cost, and continue to save towards a newer vehicle? Or should we put 10k down towards a newer vehicle now and finance the other 10k that we would owe, and do . . . I don't know what with our Honda? What the heck would you even do in this situation??
