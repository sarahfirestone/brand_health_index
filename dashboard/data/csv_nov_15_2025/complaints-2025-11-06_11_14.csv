On XX/XX/year>, I deposited a check in the amount of {$9000.00} that was provided to me by someone claiming to represent a company I applied to through a job posting on Indeed. I was told that I had been hired and that the check was to cover equipment and onboarding costs. Following their instructions, I deposited the check and believed I was following legitimate steps in starting a new job. 

I now realize that this was a scam, and I was deceived into participating in fraudulent activity. I had no intention of violating any terms or participating in anything dishonest. I truly believed I was beginning a real job opportunity. 

I understand the seriousness of the situation and deeply regret the consequences. I am kindly requesting a reconsideration of my account status. I am more than willing to cooperate fully and provide any documentation or details you may need regarding the scam and the individuals involved. My only goal is to resolve this and restore my account in good standing. 
Please let me know what steps I can take to help with the investigation and to potentially reinstate my account. 

Thank you for your time and understanding.

On XX/XX/year>, at around XXXX PM, I went with my wife and our XXXX twin babies to the XXXX, NY branch XXXX open XXXX joint checking account. Both of us were present with proper identification and ready to provide all required information. 
The branch supervisor, XXXX XXXX, refused to open our account, citing a shortage of staff. This reasoning is inconsistent with TD Bank policy, which only requires both applicants to be present with identification. When I requested a written explanation, none was provided. 
Throughout the interaction, XXXX XXXX treated us unfairly and spoke to us in a hostile and shouting manner. I explained that we had checked in on time, but she ignored this and continued being illogical and unprofessional. Her behavior caused undue stress, especially as we had twin infants with us. I am including her business card and the written confirmation I received documenting the interaction. 
I am concerned that this treatment XXXX have been influenced by bias, including XXXX bias, as there was no valid policy reason for refusing our account. This refusal of service without justification constitutes unfair treatment and lack of transparency.

08/25/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Issue : * * Incorrect late payment reporting despite proof of timely mailed payment I purchased a stroller from Target for {$290.00} on XX/XX/year>, and also purchased insurance for {$37.00} on the same day. On XX/XX/year>, I mailed a {$50.00} check payment to Target for my Target credit card balance, as I was going out of town and wanted to ensure my account remained current. This was my first time using the card in over XXXX months, and I have always paid my balances in full. 

On XX/XX/year>, I returned the stroller. I was not given a receipt and was unaware that the refund would exclude the {$37.00} insurance charge. Afterwards, I left town again and was not aware that Target never received the check. Target then reported a late payment on my credit report. 

I contacted my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and confirmed that the {$50.00} check was never cashed. I have attached a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX verifying that the check was mailed on time and never presented for processing, meaning it was lost in the mail a circumstance outside my control. 

Despite my repeated attempts to resolve this with Target, including multiple goodwill requests and providing the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX proof, Target has refused to correct the negative reporting. I have otherwise maintained a XXXX balance with Target for over XXXX months since this purchase and have an excellent history of paying my accounts in full and on time. 

This single error has caused a drop of approximately XXXX points in my credit score, severely harming my financial reputation and opportunities. I believe it is unfair and a bad business practice for Target to refuse to correct this issue when I can clearly demonstrate I made the effort to pay on time. 

* * Requested Resolution : * * I am requesting that Target remove the late payment remark from my credit report and update the account to reflect paid as agreed/current, as the missed posting was due to a lost check and not a failure to pay.

09/05/25,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Repossession,Notice to repossess,"Predatory Auto Loan & Repossession Dispute Letter Date : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX TO : Tennessee Attorney General Consumer Affairs Division XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN XXXX XXXX AND : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Submitted online at : https : //www.consumerfinance.govXXXXXXXX Re : Complaint and Dispute Regarding Predatory Auto Loan and Unlawful Repossession Dear Sir or Madam : I am filing this complaint against TD Auto Finance and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN regarding what I believe are predatory lending practices, unfair loan terms, and a potentially unlawful vehicle repossession. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I was quoted a {$64000.00} vehicle price, which I now understand included a costly aftermarket warranty that was never disclosed to me during the sales process. A TD Bank escalations manager recently confirmed this. The contract was signed electronically in about 3 minutes using an outdated digital signature system, and I was never shown or provided with a physical copy to review beforehand. I was being rushed out the door as the dealers... 

Furthermore, I was given conflicting information about the repossession. A TD Bank representative initially told me I had 34 weeks before the vehicle would be sold. However, I was later told by an escalations manager that the sale would occur within 15 days. She also deflected responsibility for the disturbing and damaging repossession process to a third-party tow yard ( XXXX  in XXXX, TN ), even though TD Bank authorized the repossession. 

Additionally, the manner in which the repossession was conducted raises serious legal concerns. On the night of the repossession ( approximately XXXX XXXX  ), the tow truck operator : - Backed over my neighbors lawn to access my vehicle and had no right or authorization to enter their property line. 
- Damaged my neighbors lawn, tree and the XXXX XXXX while extracting the vehicle. 
- Broke into my car to confirm the VIN number, triggering the car alarm, which disturbed multiple families in our neighborhood, including children. 
The actions taken caused substantial property damage, public disturbance, and distress, and were witnessed by myself, my wife and others. The repossession agent also appeared uncertain about whether the vehicle was the correct target, raising questions about the competence and legality of their actions. The agent also appeared and smelled intoxicated, which would explain the carelessness of trespassing on and damaging my neighbors property. This conduct constitutes a "" breach of the peace, '' which invalidates the right to repossess without judicial process. 

Here are the troubling loan and financial terms : - Financed amount : {$67000.00} - Downpayment : {$1100.00} - APR : 9.69 % - Daily interest : $ XXXX - Loan payoff : {$63000.00} - Total repayment with interest : approx. {$90000.00} - Repo recovery fee : {$4400.00} - Trade-in vehicle : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( low mileage ) The vehicles fair market auction value is currently {$38000.00} {$45000.00}, meaning our family would owe an estimated {$26000.00} deficiency if I allow the auction to proceed. However, reclaiming the vehicle would cost {$4400.00} now, and I would then owe approximately {$48000.00} over the next 3 years in payments. I have identified a more affordable vehicle that better suits my familys needs, and opting for that would save me {$29000.00} over 3 years and help rebuild my credit. 

Given the rushed contract signing, inflated sale price, hidden add-ons, conflicting repossession timelines, and overall treatment, I respectfully request the following : 1. An investigation into the loan and dealership ( XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, TN ) practices for potential TILA and Tennessee Consumer Protection Act violations. 
2. Oversight of TD Banks repossession and communication procedures. 
3. Review of the third-party repo vendor 's conduct and damage caused during the recovery. 

I am seeking relief and transparency. I would welcome the opportunity to provide further information or supporting documentation. 

Sincerely, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX Update as of XX/XX/XXXX : I have emailed and mailed the enclosed letter to the TD Auto Finance Customer Resolution Department, which serves as a formal debt dispute under applicable federal and Tennessee law. I am seeking a fair resolution and request that all collection and sale activity be paused until this matter is fully reviewed. Our vehicle was repossessed on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to receive any formal notice regarding the sale of our XXXX XXXX, confirmation of its location, a copy of the loan contract or the exact amount of money required to reinstate the loan to get access to use the vehicle and where such payment needs to be mailed. 
ENCLOSED : LETTER MAILED TO TD AUTO FINANCE CUSTOMER RESOLUTION DEPARTMENT LOCATED AT THE ADDRESSES LISTED BELOW. 

Formal Dispute and Request for Documentation Date : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, TN XXXX XXXX Account ending in XXXX TO : TD Auto Finance ATTN : Customer Resolution Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, MI XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Re : Formal Dispute of Loan Terms and Request to Halt Sale of Repossessed Vehicle Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to formally dispute the loan terms and balance related to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was recently repossessed. I request that you immediately halt any sale or auction of the vehicle while this dispute is under review. 

Upon recent investigation, I discovered that the {$64000.00} cash price charged by XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, TN included an extensive and expensive aftermarket warranty that was not disclosed to me at the time of sale. A TD Bank escalations manager confirmed this to me directly. She also confirmed that I signed using an outdated electronic signature system and was never provided with a physical copy of the contract to review before signing. The contract process was rushed and completed in approximately 3 minutes as the dealership was closing. 

Additionally, I was given inconsistent and conflicting information about the repossession and resale process. I was initially told by one TD Bank representative that I had 34 weeks before the car would be sold. However, the TD Bank escalations manager informed me that the vehicle would be sold in approximately 15 days. She also claimed that the repossession process and resulting disturbance ( including property damage and neighborhood disruption ) was not TD Banks responsibility, and I was directed to complain to XXXX  in XXXX, TN. 

The current loan details are troubling : - Total amount financed : {$67000.00} - XXXX : 9.69 % - Loan payoff balance : {$63000.00} - Total repayment with interest over 74 months : approximately {$90000.00} - Repo fee : {$750.00} | Total due to recover vehicle : {$4400.00} - Original downpayment : {$1100.00} - Daily interest accrual : $ XXXX - Trade-in allowance : {$63000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This contract structure, coupled with an inflated vehicle price and a rushed electronic signature process, raises significant concerns about procedural fairness and potential predatory lending practices. 

As of late XX/XX/XXXX, the fair market auction value for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in typical condition is between {$38000.00} and {$45000.00}. If the vehicle sells at auction in that range, I could be left owing approximately {$26000.00} on a vehicle I no longer own or control. In contrast, if I retrieve the vehicle by paying {$4400.00} and resume $ XXXX payments, our family will pay around {$48000.00} over the next three years.

It has been difficult to get the kids to XXXX  and school without 2 cars and sudden loss of transportation without warning. So, alternatively, Ive reserved a newer, more affordable vehicle ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to replace my wifes repossessed XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the changes going from XXXX to XXXX children in a higher inflation economy, the monthly payment is more suitable for our familys needs. With a {$4400.00} downpayment and a co-sign from my mother, the monthly payment would be approximately $ XXXX {$29000.00} less over three years than continuing with the XXXX  loan. This would also help repair my credit more sustainably. 

Given the inconsistent communication, questionable loan structure, and pressure under which I signed, I request the following immediately : 1. A full accounting of the loan, including itemized charges and all added warranties or products and confirmation of whether these added warranties stay with the car or can be sold or reimbursed in a prorated fashion.

2. The original, signed loan agreement and Truth in Lending Act disclosures.

3. A complete timeline and notice history for the repossession and auction.

4. Written confirmation that the auction will be postponed until this dispute is resolved. 

This is a formal debt dispute under applicable federal and Tennessee law. I am seeking a fair resolution and request that all collection and sale activity be paused until this matter is fully reviewed. Our vehicle was repossessed on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have yet to receive any formal notice regarding the sale of our XXXX XXXX, confirmation of its location, a copy of the loan contract or the exact amount of money required to reinstate the loan to get access to use the vehicle and where such payment needs to be mailed.

I immediately filed a fraud claim with Target. The company shut down my account and reissued a new card number. I've had to file other credit card fraud claims in the past, and the issues are typically resolved within a week. It has now been nearly four months, and these charges are still on my card. I've called the Target Fraud Department on at least 6 different occasions, two of which I spoke to a supervisor. I get different answers from each person I speak with. Today, I spoke with a supervisor that told me that they have "" no specific timeframe '' for responding to fraud claims, as they are behind and got "" slammed with fraud cases all at once. '' I mentioned that I've already filed a claim with the MN Attorney General, and they advised the company has 90 business days to resolve the claim. When I told today 's supervisor this information, she said she was unfamiliar with the laws, as she doesn't live in MN. Target is a MN based company. I asked how a supervisor in the fraud department could be unfamiliar with the laws dealing with fraud, and she said she only goes by what her company says.

I do not know what else to do to get these charges removed from my account.

To pay for this purchase I opened a new line of credit for {$4200.00}. This line of credit was serviced and administered directly by XXXX XXXX but was backed by TD Bank, NA. The account remained in good standing with the total one time charge balance being paid in full and the monthly charges paid on time. 

In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX notified it's customers that they were terminating their servicing platform and that customers would need to establish new accounts directly with XXXX Bank to continue making payments and manage their line of credit. I began this process and encountered many issues. I worked directly with XXXX and TD Bank and was informed that because I had previously had opened and closed lines of credit with TD Bank that there were issues with my online access. I made payments via phone while attempting to work through issues, which were never fully resolved. On XX/XX/XXXX I made the request via TD Bank phone customer support to close my account, and terminate all monthly charges and services. TD Bank agreed to do this and informed me my account was closed. 

In XXXX of XXXX I began receiving statements at my home via postal mail that I had a past due balance incurring late fees. On XX/XX/XXXX I called TD Bank to inquire and was told my account was closed, but the balance was for services in XXXX that had not posted when my account was closed, and the late fee was because the amount was not paid by the XXXX due date. I agreed to pay the {$58.00} to satisfy the balance on my account and be completely done with this line of credit. 

In XXXX of XXXX I received a notification from XX/XX/XXXXthat there was a change to my credit. Upon logging in my credit score had dropped over 220 points from the low XXXX to a high XXXX. The reason for this was that TD BankXXXX XXXX had reported a past due balance, unpaid since XXXX with multiple late fees. Upon further investigation a charge of {$1.00} was applied to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the day AFTER I had made the final payment, on an account that was closed since XX/XX/XXXX. Nobody from TD Bank has been able to explain why there was a charge of {$1.00} applied to my account. 

Since XXXX I have made several calls attempting to come to a resolution. I have filed disputes with all XXXX major credit bureaus. On XX/XX/XXXX I post marked a XXXX Consumer Credit Report Dispute form found here -XX/XX/XXXXI requested that TD Bank send me a letter showing the date the account was formally closed, as well as my detailed statements of charges and payments from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I also requested that they zero the account balance and retract all negative reports from all credit reporting agencies, thus returning my credit score to the XXXX range it was prior to their initial report of delinquency. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I have received no phone calls, no voice mails, no email, and no postal mail from TD Bank or XXXX in regards to the XXXX form I submitted which is beyond the 30 day deadline they have to respond. The reports are still showing on my credit report negatively impacting my credit score, and the original {$1.00} balance from XX/XX/XXXX is now up to {$47.00} in late fees and additional charges. 

Please someone help me hold this company accountable. I am trying to buy a home and send my daughter to college and this company has made that increasingly difficult over {$1.00} that was fraudulently charged to my account over 2 months after the account was closed and I made final payments.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,KS,660XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/01/25,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,15641100

I called the customer representative and the person who picked up the phone was rude and started yelling at me calling me a fraudster. The exchange was so vile that I hung up the phone.

I came back to XXXX without my medical procedure.

I sent them the letter stating that I would be receiving the check which includes a phone number and address of the issuing party as well as ID that had all my names on it. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the bank and my funds were still not available. I was told that I was being put on an extended hold til XX/XX/XXXX.

When I sent an email to the TD Bank Branch President, I was told "" There is no extended hold on your account. I advised you, the name on your profile had to be ammended. I expedited, which takes about 3 days. I also advised that once that is updated, then I will be able to have them remove the block. As of today, the name change has not been updated.

09/05/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I am filing this complaint against TD Bank regarding their denial of access to available funds in direct contradiction to their published Funds Availability Policy. According to TD Banks policy, funds from electronic deposits such as ACH transfers should be made available on the business day the deposit is received, and cashiers checks purchased with collected funds must be made available immediately. Despite this, TD Bank withheld my funds and refused to issue a cashiers check even though my account balance showed sufficient available funds. This incident occurred at the TD Bank branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NJ XXXX. During this interaction, I was asked to provide evidence of the source of funds, and I provided TD Bank with confirmation of the transaction directly from XXXX. Even after doing so, I was still denied access. As a direct result, I was unable to access my own money on the day I needed it, which prevented me from completing the purchase of a car that same day. This caused me significant financial harm and personal inconvenience, as I lost the opportunity to obtain transportation I had arranged and budgeted for. 

These actions contradict TD Banks own Funds Availability Policy and violate Regulation CC ( 12 C.F.R. Part 229 ), which requires that financial institutions make certain deposits and payments available promptly. A fair resolution would be for TD Bank to reimburse me for the financial losses and inconvenience caused by their refusal to provide access to my available funds, including the lost opportunity to purchase the car on the scheduled day. I also request that TD Bank be required to review and correct its funds availability practices to ensure compliance with Regulation CC and its own published policy, and provide written confirmation that this issue has been addressed so it does not recur in the future.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NJ,070XX,None,Consent provided,Web,09/05/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15736680

Between XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, a series of unauthorized transactions totaling {$360.00} occurred on my debit card ending in XXXX. These transactions took place in Florida, but I was in my home state of New York and did not travel during that period. 

Disputed Transactions : XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX {$92.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX {$45.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX {$74.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$67.00} XX/XX/year>XX/XX/XXXX {$25.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$9.00} XX/XX/year> XXXX XXXX XXXX {$50.00} Total Amount : {$360.00} I noticed these unauthorized transactions and immediately reported them to TD Bank. The bank denied my claim, stating : 1. The card was in my possession.

2. Chip cards can not be replicated.

3. The correct PIN was used.

4. Their decision was an internal one, and they refused to provide documentation supporting their conclusion. 

Why This Denial is Improper : 1. Regulation E places the burden of proof on the bank to show that I authorized the transactions. The use of a chip and PIN alone does not prove authorization.

2. Chip card fraud is possible through methods such as internal point-of-sale compromise, skimming, and malware. My possession of the physical card does not exclude the possibility of fraud.

3. I requested copies of all documents, logs, and evidence TD Bank used to reach its conclusion, including surveillance, terminal logs, and investigator notes.

4. TD Bank refused to provide this information, stating that the decision was internal, in violation of 1005.11 ( b ) ( 1 ) ( ii ), which requires the bank to provide copies of documentation relied upon to deny the claim.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,10036,None,Consent provided,Web,08/21/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15442669

TD Bank orchestrated the systematic theft of a safe deposit box containing XXXX championship rings valued $ XXXX $ XXXX while I served as court-appointed guardian. On XX/XX/XXXX, TD Bank drilled the box without notification despite having my guardianship papers on file clearly stating legal authority to access all accounts. The bank sold the contents in XXXX while my ward was still alive, then spent five years covering up the theft through manager deception. 

When I attempted access in XXXX, XXXX different managers gave identical false scripts claiming "" expired guardianship '' despite TD Bank 's own records showing valid authority. Manager # 1 initially accepted my paperwork then disappeared. Managers # 2-5 refused to acknowledge the bank 's own documentation. Meanwhile, bank statements prove TD Bank actively managed joint accounts while simultaneously claiming guardianship restrictions prevented safe deposit access - clear contradictory behavior exposing deliberate obstruction. 

The theft resulted in XXXX  abuse of XXXX victims. My XXXX ward died XX/XX/XXXX, denied adequate medical care because stolen assets prevented healthcare funding. My XXXX year-old ward continues suffering as burial papers were stolen, preventing proper end-of-life planning. TD Bank representative ignored multiple settlement demands ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) and called me then refused to respond when I returned the call. 

This occurred at TD Bank 's XXXX XXXX branch. The systematic manager cover-up, contradictory account management, and settlement obstruction demonstrate institutional misconduct beyond individual error. Given TD Bank 's {$1.00} XXXX Anti-Money Laundering penalty in XXXX, this case reveals ongoing corporate culture enabling theft operations targeting vulnerable elderly customers under guardianship protection.

XXXX and XXXX  both show the account as Paid/Closed with {$0.00} balance and Current no late payments reported. 
XXXX, however, reports the same account with multiple derogatory late payments ( 30, 60, 90, 120 days past due ) even after the account was closed and paid.

This creates direct contradictions between the bureaus. By law ( FCRA 607 ( b ) ), information furnished must be reported with maximum possible accuracy. An account can not be both Paid/Closed with {$0.00} balance and seriously delinquent at the same time.

Additionally, this account does not list a clear Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) on XXXX  or XXXX, which is required under FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ). Without an accurate DOFD, the account is being misreported and potentially re-aged. 
Because of these contradictions and violations : I am requesting that the CFPB investigate both XXXX  ( for verifying inaccurate information ) and TD Bank/Target ( for furnishing inconsistent data ). 
If the furnisher and CRA can not reconcile these inconsistencies and demonstrate verifiable accuracy, I am requesting complete deletion of the account from my XXXX  file.

Despite this, TD Bank issued a XX/XX/year>2025 statement showing the account as open with a {$1.00} balance and {$1.00} minimum due. On XX/XX/year>2025, TD processed an internal Payment XXXX XXXX  for {$1.00}. This XXXX  balance was generated after closure and never should have appeared. 

This account was already the subject of multiple fraud disputes.

08/26/25,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with additional products or services purchased with the loan,"My father had passed away in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, a little less than a year ago. As the personal representative of the estate I had advised we would be keeping the vehicle. I spoke with the lien holder- TD Auto Finance , and I personally had been added to the loan, I am now the primary borrower due to my fathers death. I had advised them monthly payments would continue. I have since being added to the loan paid between XXXX and XXXX XXXX dollars approximately. I have spoken with the Massachusetts RMV regarding having the vehicle titled in my name, and was advised to have the lienholder send me this title directly to then take the title to the RMV with a list of documents in order to have the vehicle legally registered and titled in my name. The lienholder is refusing to send me this title as the loan has not yet been paid in full. They will only send the title to the RMV of Massachusetts, who is advising they will return the title to the lienholder as additional paperwork is not present, and as a result they are unable to make any updates. I have been in contact with the RMV of MA multiple times over the last 10 months with no other resolution aside from receiving the title and manually making these changes with them in person with all of the requested documents, including the title. As I have been in contact with the lienholder they have consistently refused to send this title to me directly despite having accepted the funds for payments since I have been added to the loan. The vehicle in question has sat in my driveway for well over a year while Ive dealt with this. Ive requested the title be sent to me multiple times and have been denied despite having provided proof of insurance, ( on a vehicle I can not drive ) the payments on a consistent basis, and multiple requests. I cant drive the car as its yet to be registered or titled in my name, but they have added me to the loan, and as a result I am obligated to make these payments or risk adverse credit reporting. This is essentially extortion like behavior. Either risk adverse credit reporting, and lose the x amount of funds Ive put into the vehicle since having been added to the loan, or pay off the entire amount in order for TD Auto Finance to send me the title directly for me to then make these changes without the need of the lien holder. I have provided TD auto finance with all documents requested in order for them to understand that my father has passed, and that I am under all legal aspects the executor of the estate. There is no other way to make these changes with the RMV, and as a result I feel extorted by this lien holder as I am unable to use , drive, register, or title this vehicle in my name despite being legally obligated to make these payments. This is an absolutely abhorrent business practice especially to someone whos lost a loved and close family member less than a year ago.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,MA,02145,None,Consent provided,Web,08/26/25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,15489305

I have a TD Bank account with the number XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that TD Bank froze my account. I went to the bank immediately. After a few hours, TD personnel finally found out that the problem was that someone had been depositing money into my account by accident. The teller had never encountered this problem before. They told me it was unlikely that whoever deposited the money would come looking for it. 

At this point, I had already spent the money. It was my first month of gig work for a new company and I thought that the deposits had come from them since it was deposited right after my second job with them. I had so little work that month that I had already spent it on groceries and rent by the time I was contacted by you. My account statement shows the following deposits which I assume are what you are demanding repayment of : XX/XX/XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX ACH DEPOSIT, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I was later called by someone who identified themselves as "" XXXX XXXX '' from the NJ XXXX XXXX TD Bank branch. I did not get an exact spelling of her name, but I do have the branch phone number she called me from : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX. She said that she'd try and negotiate a way for me to pay back the bank in monthly installments. I have never been to the NJ XXXX XXXX TD Bank office so I do not know why she was involved. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, she called me back to inform me that the other bank would not accept monthly installments. They demanded that both installments be paid in full. 

While I paid the initial sum of {$420.00} for the first installment, I am unable to pay such a large sum as {$1900.00} unless I can do it in installments. I can afford to pay you {$200.00} per month until the remaining {$1900.00} is paid off. I think this proposal is more than fair given that it was you or some entity you worked with who made the wrongful deposits and you have never been able to explain why this happened. In fact, you have never given me anything in writing about this whole situation. Instead you had a person I dont know from a bank I have never been to tell me over the phone that I have to pay the entire sum immediately. 

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

08/17/25,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I am filing a complaint against Target / TD Bank and XXXX XXXX ( debt collection company ) regarding inaccurate and misleading credit reporting. 

Target has stated that the account in question was charged off and is now being handled by the debt collection company XXXX XXXX. However, this is not accurately reflected on my credit report. Instead, the account continues to report as charged off month after month, which is misleading and a violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

A charge-off is a one-time accounting event and should not be reported repeatedly each month as if it is ongoing. This practice makes it appear as though new negative activity is happening, which is inaccurate and damaging. In addition, although Target has confirmed that the debt has been transferred to XXXX XXXX, my credit report does not reflect that the account has been transferred, sold, or updated to show a new debt collector. Instead, it continues to report incorrectly. 

I have written to Target / TD Bank six times to resolve this issue, but they have failed to correct the reporting. This constitutes continued reporting of false and inaccurate information to TransUnion and Equifax. 

What I am requesting : A full investigation into why Target/TD Bank continues to report the account as charged off month after month. 

Correction of my credit report so that the account is accurately reflected ( charge-off noted once, not repeated each month ). 

Updated reporting to reflect the transfer of the account to XXXX XXXX, if they are in fact the current debt owner/collector. 

Written confirmation of the corrections made. 

Target / TD Banks continued misreporting is harmful, misleading, and a violation of my rights under the FCRA and potentially the FDCPA.

08/23/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I am filing a complaint against TD Bank regarding a recent debit card transaction that was mishandled in a way that caused significant financial inconvenience. 

On [ XX/XX/year> ], I made a purchase with my TD Bank debit card. The transaction did not appear on my account in any form not as pending and not as a posted transaction for approximately one week. Then, without warning, the charge suddenly posted on XX/XX/year> and immediately pushed my account into the negative. 

What makes this situation especially troubling is that I am enrolled in TD Banks overdraft protection program, which is specifically intended to prevent this type of outcome. Despite this, TD Bank still allowed the transaction to overdraft my account. This raises serious concerns about whether TD Banks overdraft protection is being properly administered and whether customers are being misled about the coverage they are supposed to receive. 

Because the transaction did not appear in my account for over a week, I had no ability to anticipate or manage the impact. This kind of delayed posting combined with TD Banks failure to apply overdraft protection constitutes an unfair and negligent banking practice that harms consumers. 

I am requesting that the CFPB investigate the following : 1. Why TD Bank allowed a transaction to post more than a week late without ever appearing as pending. 
2. Why TD Banks overdraft protection failed to prevent my account from going negative.

3. Whether TD Bank is adequately disclosing the limitations of its overdraft protection to customers.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,33068,None,Consent provided,Web,08/23/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15479352

On XX/XX/year> I deposited {$9000.00} cash into my account. A few days later, I discovered two large unauthorized transactions one for approximately {$4000.00} and one for {$5000.00}. The {$5000.00} transaction was pending when I contacted the bank immediately to report the fraud. I was instructed to wait until it posted before a dispute could be filed. I complied and opened a dispute for the XXXX as soon as possible, in the middle of filing the dispute i was told there was more small transactions totaling to about {$99.00} so the claim was now for {$4000.00} and the {$5000.00} was pending still. 

Despite my prompt reporting, the bank denied my claim, stating that because I logged into online banking during the dispute process, this showed I was aware of and authorized the charges. This conclusion is incorrect. 

The only reasons I logged into my account were : 1.To confirm my {$9000.00} cash deposit after deposit at the branch because before this fraud occurred and i deposited {$9000.00} i had Deposited {$3000.00} and there was {$2500.00} taken out of my account to settle a charged off account that i did not know about so i frequently checked my account to make sure the {$9000.00} i just deposited after losing {$2500.00} was still there and no more money was pulled from my account for any debts if i had any, after a few days i came passed i came across the {$4000.00} and {$5000.00} transactions which is when i immediately contacted the bank. 

2.After the claim was submitted i logged in to view the pending fraudulent charges after reporting them as i was told to monitor my account for the provisional credit that I was told would be issued. 

Logging into my account to check my balance and monitor a dispute does not constitute authorization of fraudulent charges. 

Under Regulation E ( 12 CFR Part 1005 ), I am entitled to protection against unauthorized electronic fund transfers as long as I reported the fraud promptly, which I did. The bank has failed to comply with its obligations by wrongfully denying my claim and refusing to issue provisional credit. 

Requested Resolution : Reversal of the denial decision. 
Issuance of the appropriate provisional credit.

08/08/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,"Complaint Summary : This is a follow-up to my prior CFPB complaint ( Case XXXX  [ insert prior case number ] ) against TD Bank XXXX The case was closed without the company addressing critical issues, including a promised {$140.00} credit, the {$560.00} still owed to me, and the direct financial damages caused by their mishandling specifically my eviction and related costs. 

Details : In XX/XX/year>, I deposited {$290.00} cash into a TD Bank ATM and received a {$270.00} XXXX transfer just before my rent was due. TD Bank closed my account the day before my deposit, yet the ATM and card still accepted the transaction without warning. I contacted the bank the next day to report the issue, but they delayed resolution for an unreasonable amount of time. 

During calls, TD Bank admitted they gave me false information about my account status and promised a {$140.00} credit for their error. This was never honored and was ignored in their CFPB response. Their delay directly caused me to miss rent and led to my eviction, along with moving costs, court fees, and personal losses all of which I can document. 

Resolution Requested : Immediate payment of the {$140.00} credit previously promised. 
Refund of the {$560.00} still owed to me. 
Compensation for eviction-related damages, including rent arrears, court costs, moving expenses, and personal losses caused by XXXX  XXXX  delay and misinformation. 

Reason for New Filing : The previous case was closed without these issues being addressed. I am requesting the CFPB to reopen or re-investigate and hold TD Bank fully accountable for the financial and personal harm caused.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,32808,None,Consent provided,Web,08/08/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15174935

Upon detailed review, your agency has violated multiple federal statutes, which renders your claim legally unenforceable and subject to penalties. Violations Noted : 1. Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. - No proper validation or original contract has been provided upon request. Misrepresentation of the debt constitutes a clear violation. 2. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. - Reporting alleged debts to credit bureaus without verification is unlawful and constitutes willful damage to my reputation and financial standing. 3. Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. - Failure to disclose key lending terms, interest obligations, and failure to provide signed documentation breaches federal law. 4. Case Law Supporting This Position : - XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Additionally, you have failed to provide : - A wet-ink signature contract establishing lawful obligation ; - A full chain of assignment/title showing lawful ownership of the alleged debt ; - Verified accounting records in accordance with GAAP standards.

DEMAND FOR REMEDY : You are hereby demanded to : - Cease and desist all collection attempts, correspondence, or calls related to this matter ; - Clear and discharge all alleged debts associated with my name, estate, or SSN ; - Remove all tradelines related to this account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Provide written confirmation of said discharge and tradeline deletion within 30 days of receipt of this letter. Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action for damages under the above-mentioned federal statutes and relevant state consumer protection laws. All rights are expressly reserved, without prejudice ( UCC 1-308 ).

09/05/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Relief demanded : Permanent deletion/suppression of the TD Bank N.A . tradeline across all CRAs. No corrections or updates.

Summary of the problem ( inconsistent bureau reporting ) : The same TD Bank N.A. credit card account ( opened XX/XX/XXXX ; last payment XX/XX/XXXX ) is reported materially differently by XXXX  and XXXX, while XXXX  shows no tradeline at all. These contradictions violate the FCRAs accuracy and reinvestigation duties and Regulation V ( Furnisher Rule ), and fail XXXX XXXX standards for accurate, consistent coding. 

What each bureau shows ( evidence attached ) : XXXX  ( report generated XX/XX/XXXX ) : Status = Paid in settlement. {$9600.00} written off. Comment = Account paid in full for less than full balance. ( Internally contradictory : it can not be paid in full and less than full simultaneously. ) Extensive CO/late history displayed. 

XXXX  ( report generated XX/XX/XXXX ) : Status = Payment after charge-off/collection ; Comment = Settled ; less than full balance ; Balance = {$0.00} ( updated XX/XX/XXXX ) ; Payment history not available. 

XXXX : No TD Bank tradeline appears.

Why this violates federal law and industry standards : FCRA 607 ( b ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ) Maximum possible accuracy.

Different statuses/remarks/balances/payment histories across CRAs ( and a total absence at XXXX  ) are inaccurate and misleading for the same account.

FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ), ( a ) ( 5 ), ( a ) ( 7 ) Reinvestigation duties & Method of Verification ( MoV ). 
I previously disputed and was told the tradeline was verified, yet no actual documentation or MoV was provided. Under 611 ( a ) ( 7 ) I demand the precise method, data, and documents used to verify. If unverifiable, it must be deleted, not corrected.

FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), 623 ( a ) ( 2 ), 623 ( b ) Furnisher accuracy & investigation duties.

TD Bank ( or any assignee ) must only furnish accurate information and must reasonably investigate upon notice from a CRA. Furnishing contradictory statuses and remarks ( e.g., XXXX  paid in full for less than full vs. XXXX settled ; less than full ; balance blank vs. {$0.00} ; payment history present vs. none ) breaches 623.

FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) & 15 U.S.C. 1681c ( c ) DOFD/obsolescence framework.

Any re-aging or inconsistent DOFD would be unlawful. Provide the documented DOFD furnished to each CRA and reconcile differences. If DOFD can not be proven consistently, the tradeline must be deleted.

Regulation V ( 12 C.F.R. Part 1022, Subpart E ) : 1022.42 ( Furnisher policies for accuracy/integrity ) 1022.43 ( Direct dispute duties ) These require policies ensuring consistent and reliable furnishing. The current cross-bureau contradictions show a failure of accuracy/integrity controls. 

XXXX XXXX compliance failures ( industry standard adopted by CRAs ). 
The account status/remarks, current balance field ( blank at XXXX  vs. {$0.00} at XXXX  ) , payment history display, and special comment language conflict across bureaus. XXXX XXXX requires aligned coding for : Account Status, Payment Rating/History, Current Balance, Special Comment ( e.g., Settled for less ), and Date fields. These inconsistent codings mislead lenders and violate 607 ( b ).

Securitization/ ownership & UCC presentment ( for 623 direct-to-furnisher issues ) : If the account was sold, assigned, securitized, or otherwise transferred, the furnisher must show lawful authority to continue furnishing : UCC 3-501 Present the original instrument/contract upon demand.

UCC 9-210 Provide proof of claim and chain of assignment.

If TD Bank or any assignee can not produce proof of ownership and assignment, continued furnishing is false and unlawful under FCRA 607 ( b ) /623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and must cease with deletion at all CRAs.

Permissible purpose ( FCRA 604 ) as applicable.

If any entity has accessed or continues to access my report for this account without a current, lawful purpose tied to a valid obligation it owns, that is an additional violation ; remove any such inquiries and include documentation of permissible purpose.

Consumer harm : These contradictions depress my creditworthiness, jeopardize financing, and harm my business and personal finances.

My former boss, XXXX XXXX, had access to all of his employees ' personal data. He fraudulently obtained my signature and the signature of my colleague, who is also involved in this case, in order to get a loan for a car purchase. He also did the same with other employees, taking out loans for them at car dealerships through his managers, without the people being present, just by having their signatures on paper.

I have never owned this car for which the loan was issued. I was unaware of the existence of a loan in my name and my colleague 's name. I have never had access to the TD Bank account and have not made any banking transactions. I have no idea where or how this car was used, or how this car was sold or given to someone without my presence or my colleague 's presence, and without our signatures. This is fraud, and my former colleague and I have suffered from the actions of TD bank, which issued a loan without our knowledge. All operations with this loan, the account, and the car itself were carried out without my knowledge or my former colleague 's knowledge. XXXX XXXX fraudulently obtained the car and the loan for it, and somehow, with the help of his lawyer, he sold or gave this car away, and for some reason, the bank considers my former colleague and me to be at fault.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,FL,33311,None,Consent provided,Web,08/19/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15380087

I was informed that the secure credit card would automatically take the funds from a savings account linked to it to satisfy a balance if there was any when the account was created. When the credit card was dispersed I never activated the card and I never used it. WhenI logged into my online platform I was not able to see the card either. I was contacted by td about a balance sometime in XXXX and eas informed the account was closed as a result. I went in branch and informed them I never used the card or activated it so there could not have been a balance. I logged in showing them the card did not even display on my online platform. Td then realized their error and explained they had created a separate account when they issued the credit card so I was not able to see the credit card on my end nor was I informed of any annual fee, nor could I because of Td 's mistake see that an annual fee was due. The bank representative after acknowledging the mistake of the bank had them reverse the late fees and they only took the XXXX dollar annual fee as a payment. They also merged the profiles so I could then see the credit card and because they had closed that card already they issued me another credit card the same secured td cash type again. I have since realized however td has been displaying this account as a delinquent account of XXXX  days or XXXX  days despite reversing the charges and acknowledging i was not at fault. I have reached out to td several times by call and I have also sent a letter in XX/XX/XXXX asking them to rectify the issue by fixing reporting the account as delinquent. To date I have not received a response from them. This has resulted in my credit report being flagged by lenders who have not been willing to extend credit to me referencing this account and also has resulted in my not being able to find housing in certain areas.

The total amount disputed is {$350.00}, representing multiple unauthorized charges that occurred over time. Most recently, another {$29.00} charge appeared on XX/XX/year>, despite receiving confirmation from XXXX XXXX that the account was canceled in XX/XX/year>. I have even gotten a new Target Card with a different account number since then and yet, XXXX XXXX was allowed to charge another recurring {$29.00} charge. I have since frozen the card, as it is clear my previous attempts to resolve this have been ineffective. 

Targets dispute process has been disorganized and exhausting. I have : Submitted documents by mail as requested. 

Spoken to multiple dispute supervisors- all of whom identify only by first name. 

Been told contradictory information depending on who I speak with. 

Been informed that the case was closed due to lack of documentation, only to be later told that multiple caseworkers were involved and some of the disputes are still open. They opened a total of 12 disputes for each recurring charge and gave them to multiple caseworkers to investigate.

I have no single point of contact, and there is no way to escalate to a higher authority or verify that my documentation is being reviewed properly. Ive been told to "" wait for a final resolution '' while receiving automated letters stating my dispute is denied- often for vague or factually inaccurate reasons. 

At this point, I am left with no confidence that Target/TD Bank is handling my dispute in good faith, and Im requesting your assistance to compel them to fully review all documentation and issue a refund for the total disputed amount.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,SC,29579,None,Consent provided,Web,09/05/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15746599

This cancellation is also documented in my official IRS Wage and Income Transcript, confirming that TD Bank discharged the debt and reported the canceled amount to the IRS as income. 

Despite this, the account is still being reported to the credit bureaus with a balance, charge-off status, and derogatory payment history. This is inaccurate, misleading, and violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), IRS regulations, and XXXX XXXX credit reporting standards. 

I previously submitted disputes to Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion with supporting documents, including the 1099-C and IRS transcript . The CRAs stated the information was verified, but it remains materially false based on the evidence. TD Bank, as the furnisher of the data, is responsible for correcting or deleting inaccurate information once the debt has been canceled. 

I am now escalating this issue to the CFPB because TD Bank is furnishing data that contradicts official IRS filings and is failing to fulfill its obligations under FCRA 1681s-2 ( a ) and 1681s-2 ( b ). This continued inaccurate reporting is harming my credit profile and financial opportunities.

08/25/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,Changes in loan terms during or after closing,"This letter is in hopes of reclaiming a {$10000.00} deposit I lost due to my working with TD Bank for a conventional mortgage I applied for. I received the Qualification Letter on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the commitment letter. The process started late, and my Loan officer, XXXX XXXX, kept telling me that TD Bank was understaffed due to vacations. Early on, I asked if I should consider another lender because I did not want to go over my commitment date, so I would not lose my deposit. She assured me we would close on time. She changed the closing dates several times, and my realtor, XXXX XXXX, expressed concerns about my deposit and said he had never had so many issues working with a lender before. This would have been my XXXX home I have purchased, and I have never experienced so much confusion. As an example of the chaotic process, I attached a letter from other TD Clients with their financial information that was inadvertently sent to me, violating their privacy, due to a serious file mix-up mistake. 

We finally had a closing date of Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, my lender called me to tell me I had been declined for the loan. It was at the end of the day, and the underwriter sent the message to my loan officer and left for the weekend, leaving me with only one full business day before our closing date. She told me to extend the closing date until XX/XX/XXXX to see if we could do something about this. My realtor extended the date, and on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, she texted me asking if I had more money in the bank. I told her I had, and they were aware of it ( attached ), giving me a false hope that they might be able to correct this. Shortly after she told me that, because I had a home in Florida with my daughter, but my daughter 's name was not on the loan, they denied me funding. ( attached ). 

This was not on the original contingency letter and, therefore, should not have been pulled up 1 day before my closing date. I was not even issued a denial letter until I had to request it twice, mentioning that it should have been issued to me within 24 hours of the denial call I had received. The letter was benign and listed reasons for the denial, but never listed the Florida residence ; however, my text message exchanges clearly indicate otherwise. 

My lawyer reached out requesting that TD Bank issue me a check for {$10000.00}, but the loan officer did not reply. I reached out to 3 other mortgage lenders at the seller 's realtor 's request to see if I could get the funding. In two days, all three got back to me to say I could not be approved due to the home in Florida, and they all said this should have been caught right in the beginning. It never should have gone over 45 days. TD Bank failed me on many levels, resulting in my losing my deposit, something a bank should never allow to happen. Not to mention it cost me {$2500.00} in assessment/inspection fees. Leaving me realistically at a loss of {$12000.00}. Until now and again, this was my XXXX house application, and I never knew this could really happen.

3. Despite explaining that I was incarcerated during these years and could not have been responsible, the banks have failed to clear my name or restore my ability to open a legitimate account.

08/14/25,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,Interest rate,"Dear Consumer Protection Team, I am submitting a formal complaint regarding what I believe is an unfair and potentially deceptive lending practice by TD Bank in connection with my construction loan. 

Summary of the Issue I entered into a construction loan with TD Bank. During the construction phase, only part of the loan was disbursed. Upon the loans maturity date, TD Bank : Moved the undisbursed funds into a non-interest-bearing account ( by their own written confirmation ), Converted the loan to permanent financing, Began charging principal and interest payments on the entire original loan amount including funds I have not yet accessed and which they state are not accruing interest in their holding account. Which includes XXXX of undisbursed funds being charged interest total of over {$1300.00} a month in interest When I questioned this, TD Bank confirmed in writing : 1. Payments once your loan converts are made on the whole loan amount. 
2. Undisbursed funds have been moved to a noninterest-bearing account.

3. The process for accessing these undisbursed funds remains the same.

This appears contradictory : if the undisbursed funds are not accruing interest in TD Banks account and have not been disbursed to me, it is unclear how they can be included in my principal and interest payment calculations. 

Why I Believe This is Unfair Charging interest on funds I have not received and which TD Bank itself confirms are in a non-interest-bearing account is misleading at best and may violate fair lending or loan servicing standards. I have requested a recalculation based on disbursed funds only and a refund of overcharged interest, but TD Bank has refused, citing only my loan documents without identifying a clear clause authorizing this practice.

Requested Action I am requesting that Consumer Protection Division : Review the loan agreement and TD Banks written statements for possible violations of South Carolina lending laws. 
Determine whether TD Banks practice of charging interest on undisbursed construction loan funds is permissible. 
Assist in obtaining a recalculated loan schedule based only on the disbursed amount at the time of conversion and a refund of excess interest charges.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,SC,294XX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15280496

Date : XX/XX/XXXX To : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Email : XXXX Phone : XXXX Re : Consolidated & Supplemental Complaint TD Bank, XXXX. Compliance Failures Enabling Fraud. 
Prior CFPB Case # : XXXX ; Prior OCC Case # XXXX. 

Dear OCC and CFPB Representatives, This filing consolidates and supplements my prior complaints against TD Bank, XXXX. ( CFPB Case # XXXX ). It incorporates my previous escalation letter and provides updated evidence following TD Banks most recent denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

In that denial, TD Bank concedes that I am the victim of a scam but asserts that the wires I sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were authorized and therefore unrecoverable. The Bank declared its denial to be final. This response fails to address the central issue : authorization obtained through fraud and material misrepresentation is not valid authorization. 

I relied on false promises of a guaranteed investment contract, which TD Bank facilitated by permitting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to open and operate an account without adequate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  or fraud controls. 
Evidence of TD Banks Failures - Wires Sent : {$72000.00} wired via TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$47000.00} ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( {$25000.00} ) to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
- Fraud Acknowledged : TD Bank concedes I am the victim of a scam. 
- Refusal of Relief : Despite this acknowledgment, TD Bank refuses restitution or accountability. 
- XXXX  XXXX Demand Letter : On XX/XX/XXXX, I served TD Bank with a formal Massachusetts XXXX  XXXX demand, placing it on notice of liability for unfair and deceptive practices. 
- Industry Precedent : On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX  refunded another investor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$25000.00} for an identical Bright Vision scheme, demonstrating that peer institutions recognize their obligations to protect consumers. 
- Law Enforcement : I filed a police report in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). 
Regulatory & Legal Action I have filed complaints with CFPB, OCC, and XXXX, and I am preparing civil litigation against TD Bank to recover my {$72000.00} loss. Under Massachusetts XXXX XXXX, TD Banks refusal exposes it to treble damages exceeding {$210000.00}, plus attorneys fees and costs. 

I respectfully urge the OCC and CFPB to : XXXX. Investigate TD Banks compliance failures in account opening and monitoring. 
XXXX. Direct TD Bank to provide restitution for my {$72000.00} loss. 
XXXX. Take supervisory or enforcement measures to ensure TD Bank meets its federal and state obligations under XXXX, XXXX, and consumer protection standards.

This is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) : 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) : Credit reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. Reporting an account as late after it has been closed is inaccurate.

15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) : Once a consumer disputes information, the CRA must conduct a reasonable reinvestigation. Continuing to report late payments on a closed account without proper verification is a violation.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) : Furnishers of information ( like TD Bank ) must not furnish information that they know or should know is inaccurate. Reporting new delinquencies on a closed account falls under knowingly reporting inaccurate information.

15 U.S.C. 1681c ( a ) ( 4 ) : Obsolete or misleading information, such as continued late payment reporting after closure, must not remain on a credit report. 

I have already disputed this with XXXX  in XX/XX/2025, but the late payments are still being reported. This damages my creditworthiness unfairly.

They claim that I made the charges but when I asked them to provide authentic documentation to prove I was responsible they refused. I spoke with multiple representatives, the investigator, and a supervisor but no one was willing to help and continued to blame me for charges I did not complete. My last straw was when the supervisor told me I was supposed to receive a letter to initial the charges I did not do. I informed her I did not and she said she would send it again, she told me I had to send supporting documents such as a police report, but I didnt have a police report because I didnt know I had to file a police report because it clearly states in their terms and conditions that if I notice unauthorized charges on my account I have to contact them. It doesnt say I need to file police report once I notice the card missing. Anyway I followed all the directions on the letter including sending a copy of my drivers license and sent it to them. The letter also had no mention of sending support documents. After they received it I called them and they told me to call back in 7-10 business. I did call back and the representative basically told me that they didnt do anything with the letter, in a sense the letter was just used to quiet me for some time and waste my time. I told her I wanted to speak with the investigator to see why nothing was done with the letter and she told me he would call me back in 24-48 hours and I never received that call back. So because of there refusal to communicate with me and them discriminating me my treating my case differently than others by asking more of me than what was requested my the letter I have no choice but to file a complaint. Also, during this time they have done everything to ruin my credit score by reporting late payments, late fees, and interest charges despite there being an active appeal to their decision.

Despite this, a fraudulent charge of {$15.00} posted on XX/XX/2025. 

On XX/XX/2025, I disputed the charge. Target assured me it would be removed and a new card issued, which never happened. 

Instead, Target/TD Bank continued to add interest charges in XXXX and XXXX.

I requested the account be closed ; they did not honor this. 

On XX/XX/2025, I received their XXXX XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ). 

To prevent further harm, I paid the fraudulent balance of {$7.00} on XX/XX/2025.

I have contacted XXXX numerous times for a copy of their investigation report as well as all records of the transaction on their end, from me ordering the XXXX to cancellation. I have not been provided anything. 

I also contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX for guidance on how to file a police report. They discouraged me from doing so.

After the account was closed, I noticed that derogatory informationspecifically late paymentscontinued to appear on my credit report. This raised immediate concern, as I had fulfilled the account terms, and no new activity should have been reported after closure. 
To resolve this, I submitted several disputes directly to the credit bureaus and the original creditor, asking for a proper review and supporting documentation of the alleged delinquencies. However, instead of receiving concrete evidence or a detailed account history, I was met with generic responses that did not clarify or justify the reporting. 
It is my understanding that once an account is closed, reporting must reflect the final and accurate status as of the date of closure, in accordance with Metro 2 data furnishing standards and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

XX/XX/XXXX - reported transactions as fraud to Target. Was told that they would open a claim/investigation, and to wait until I received a questionnaire in the mail to fill out and return. 
About 3 weeks later - call back to report I still havent received questionnaire in the mail. I am told they are going to mail a new one to me. 
Next - still no questionnaire. I call again. They email me a copy that I can mail or fax back to them. I receive the physical questionnaire in the mail the next day, so I fill it out ( general questions, did anyone have access to your card, do you have roommates, what were the fraud transactions, etc ) and mail it back the next day. 
XX/XX/XXXX - first statement closes with the fraud charges, payment due XX/XX/XXXX. Total including an authorized charge from XXXX XXXX XXXX  was {$290.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( didnt realize until XX/XX/XXXX once charge is posted ) - autopay transaction charges my full statement even though setting is for minimum {$30.00}. I now owe {$0.00} on my Target statement once this clears. 
XX/XX/XXXX - my questionnaire is received at Target HQ. 
XX/XX/XXXX - After being told previously that claims take 30 days to complete, and then being told that I will receive a resolution letter in the mail within 30 days of this questionnaire being received, I am now told that the time frame is 60 days from XX/XX/XXXX to receive the resolution letter. At this point they tell me the investigation is basically complete but an agent still needs to review it. Im also told that I can contact the payment department about my autopay charging {$290.00} rather than the {$30.00} minimum balance. I am already too frustrated with the customer service calls and hoping that I just get the money back soon. At least I wasnt being charged interest since it was paid off. 
XX/XX/XXXX - No resolution letter, no refund to my account, I call back demanding answers. I am now told that I can expect a resolution letter within 90 days from when the claim was received ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
XX/XX/XXXX - No resolution letter, no refund, I call back. I get the same scripted response - an agent is assigned to my claim, they are completing an investigation, after 90 days I will receive a resolution letter in the mail so I need to wait until then. Once I point out that its been over 90 days, the rep on the phone tells me she is pushing through a refund since the time frame has already passed and Ill see the refund in my account within 5-7 business days. 
XX/XX/XXXX- No refund. No letter. I call back, am told again to wait 90 days for a letter, etc etc. I ask if there is any active refund being processed on my account and am told there is not. I ask if there is any update from XX/XX/XXXX, there is not. I point out that it has been well over 90 days and I was told a refund is being processed and should have arrived ( or at least be pending ) by XX/XX/XXXX. Now the rep finds a note on my account that there is a refund being processed, but it wasnt received until XX/XX/XXXX, so I need to wait until XXXX for a resolution letter. I ask if he means letter in the mail or money in my account and he says letter in the mail. When I ask for clarification about this because Im receiving contradictory answers on whether my claim is complete and Im being refunded or whether its still being investigated, he tells me that he can not see any decisions of any claim on his end, it still looks like it is being investigated, and that I will get a letter by XXXX.

Even if this defective product is eventually returned to me, the core issue remains : I was sold a defective item, and the merchant has refused to provide the refund they promised. My total financial loss is {$4700.00}. 

I contacted TD Bank to dispute the original {$3800.00} charge for "" Product Not as Described / Defective. '' The representative refused to investigate, citing only a 30-day policy.

From that time until XXXX, while the account remained completely inaccessible to me, TD Bank continued to deduct {$25.00} per month in maintenance/service fees. In total, about {$1500.00} was taken from the account during this frozen period. 

I only discovered the extent of these charges much later. I had no way to access the account, and I was never properly notified.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I finally came back to the XXXX to resolve this issue.

08/28/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"I am writing to file a complaint against TD Bank, N.A. regarding the repeated overdraft fees that have been charged to my account, despite my documented financial hardship and my efforts to resolve the matter directly with the bank.

My husband recently lost his job, leaving me as the sole provider for our household. While I continue to bring in income, we have struggled to keep up with major expenses such as mortgage and utilities. These challenges have caused occasional overdrafts, which have been met with punitive fees rather than reasonable accommodation from TD Bank. 

For example, my XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/2025 statement shows : Total overdraft fees : {$630.00} Year-to-date overdraft fees at that point : {$1200.00} My XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/2025 statement then shows : Total overdraft fees : {$490.00} Year-to-date overdraft fees : {$1700.00} In just two months, I was charged {$1100.00} in overdraft penalties alone. To date this year, TD Bank has taken {$1700.00} in fees from my account. While a small portion was refunded under their grace period policy earlier in the year, the bank has refused to offer any meaningful courtesy refunds in light of my situation.

These fees are not only excessive but exploitative, as they compound financial hardship instead of offering relief. Even when funds have come in through payroll, XXXX, and XXXX transfers, the repeated fees consume what stability I am trying to build.

I respectfully request that TD Bank be required to review my account, acknowledge the hardship circumstances, and refund the overdraft fees charged in 2025. At a minimum, I believe that {$1700.00} in overdraft penalties is unreasonable and should be corrected.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for holding TD Bank accountable to fair and ethical business practices.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,MD,21921,None,Consent provided,Web,08/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,15586289

And everyone that works in that branch is horribly rude and exude zero compassion. So they refused toclose the account even with the fraudulent activity. Therefore, the pending charges they were speaking of that were keeping me from closing the account. Were late fees on fraudulent charges! How does that make sense?

09/05/25,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,Trying to communicate with the company to fix an issue with the application process,"This was sent to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX loan XXXX and XXXX Attn : XXXX She offered to help me and seemed to know what she was doing but disappeared XXXX, A little bit of history on this mess. These are copies the 2 approvals of the modified loans XXXX and XXXX. They were sign and faxed by your branch in XXXX XXXX, NJ back in XX/XX/XXXX. The branch told me they would put originals in inter-company mail. You can also see here a copy of the last payment to each loan was XX/XX/XXXX till I received notice of intent to foreclose due to lack of payment. I dont understand. Since then Ive re-applied only to be turned down on loan XXXX due to lack of income. Back then It was unclear the exact month I would receive Social Security due to my income level for that year so it was not initially included. I immediately sent in a copy of the SS letter and receipt of payment into my bank account and never heard back. I also never heard back on the second loan whatsoever other than the typical its under review. Why? 

After many phone calls I was told to re-apply. I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX I did get approved on loan XXXX. Being you all gave me a hard time over everything I made a weeks worth of calls asking if I needed page one of the contract to be sent on this loan. Somehow I misplaced it. Never received an answer. I was told you were sending me out new docs. It turns out all sent me was that last page to be signed and send back. If I was told that on my 1st phone call, I could have done that from day one. Now, when was it returned to you claimed it was received late? I knew it was coming so watched every day. It arrived on Friday XX/XX/XXXX on my porch. I sign it and brought it right down to a UPS store to mail immediately that evening. I believe it was second day mail going back. According to the UPS tracking number it was received on XX/XX/XXXX yet the representative I spoke to claimed it was received a day later in the afternoon? Not sure when the 10 days started but typically its business days no? During this process while in transit I wanted to show my intent and Im really sure I went to make a payment online. I recall doing it when I looked a few days later there was no record what so ever.

After may conversations I was told to re-apply again. You can look back on records and listen to recorded conversations not only was I frustrated. I believe most of the calls were nothing more then people typing whatever they felt like. Like robots relaying whatever, unable to answer a question and basically nothing more than message takers. I was also hung up on or disconnected several times just as the conversation started I can only be construed as intentional. No one reached back out and had to start all over. I believe in one of my later conversations I called you all incompetent. This process you put people through is horrible. Also, along the way I did speak to some very nice people and some who were not qualified to even be there in my opinion. Those who I believed would move this forward turns out only a dream as the next person couldnt care less about my plight. I had asked to speak to a supervisor at least XXXX times as a result. 

When I applied the XXXX time I was told you needed some additional information taxes and homeowners insurance. I sent them in, I received a letter stating something to the effect the information was received. Shortly there after received XXXX approval and the other still under review. Then in then in the next conversation a day or XXXX later it was not approved due to missing information. Here we go again. Your process of speaking to people who know only whats in front of them is horrible. I can never recommend TD bank to anyone. This process has been grueling to say the least. Delay after delay to no fault of my own that Im aware of.

A Supervisor did call me when I was at work I told her I could not speak and please call me back a XXXX pm. She said she would try. Well I never heard back but I did receive a letter with her name and why I called to speak to her and you took the call. Now, we are in process of reviewing again. Once again, I have hopes this will move forward. But my guess it will be another bad mark against me for not providing proper documentation according to TD. 

What I also dont understand is why the approval of this one loan went back to the original terms, had an additional XXXX of charges and now you all added another {$300.00} or so to the monthly payment. I applied for help because I needed it when I lost my full time job. You also claimed Im 999 days in arrears which aint true. I applied back then as was being allowed and because I lost my full time job the day Covid was formally announced. The sad thing is I did everything you asked for more than a few times. What youre not saying is you all confused the loans, delays were on your side. Claims of not receiving docs in time. Most of the time the response I get its STILL UNDER REVIEW. If there was confusion or lack of information those who took the calls did not handle them correctly. Even speaking to some of the ladies on specifics they crisscrossed notes from one loan to the next and argued with me over that. Others were basically useless must hate their job and said they will send the underwriters a message as Im told to do. Well robots might be better suited. This went on and on and on for an unreasonable amount of time. Does anyone care? Nope TD bank filed a formal foreclosure, right? 

Well my outcome appears to targeted and railroaded. Is dealing with you just another false hope of this getting rectified? As I mentioned to you these 2 loans were and are for the same house I occupy. My primary mortgage as stated in the application taxes and homeowners insurance was part of that payment. If thats not clear revise your form dont penalize me with delays and say you dont have information. Get rid of speaking to different people every time ya call. Even others who said would call me back or help only lied I guess because they listened to my frustration. You did call back so Im once again hoping. 

Cant believe this has dragged on this long. Thanks for hearing me rant, this process has been unspeakable in part and truly believe TD is out to get my house. Dont know what I ever did to you all? 

XXXX XXXX Sent from my XXXX Also : Now this last process I once again had approval went to you branch to have it notarized mailed it in the envelope provided. XXXX XXXX needed to be mailed by XX/XX/XXXX, mailed it on XX/XX/XXXX, you received on XX/XX/XXXX. Tracking # ups XXXX. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and was. I never heard anything back on XXXX XXXX. So I called to make a payment being late of not hearing anything XXXX I paid a late fee. Following up on XXXX and to make a payment so it was no late. Both these payment I was blocked from doing on the App and why I called them in to show my intent. I believe it was when I called again there after I was told they were notarized XXXX said the other girl did it the same way and would have to apply again. I cursed and said no this is your fault. You would think someone with a hint of brains on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX would have called and said hey these were notarized incorrectly here is a copy or we will send it to the branch and you sign it again. Not only did I not receive a call I bet you they never corrected it at the branch and more than once the information I provided was acceptable on one application sent it that way again only to hear it was wrong and we need it this way. It must be your Legendary service kicking in. Alls I can say I had enough and sending in a complaint with I hope someone who can help.

Cant believe this has dragged on this long. Thanks for hearing me rant, this process has been unspeakable in part and truly believe TD is out to get my house. Dont know what I ever did to you all? But it needs to be corrected so the next individual does not have to endure this.i went through this process with XXXX XXXX, no issues gat a better rate and extended terms. You only offered extended terms. The one loan you changed it to a 10 year term upped my payment amount yet have not brought it to the current rates being offered. I saw 5.125 % your at 6.75 % why? Your motive of dragging this on and on and on and sticking it to me is Legendary!

This account is classified as new by TD Bank, but I am not a new customer I have banked with TD Bank before.

This is vague, unprofessional, and fails to justify the removal of already-cleared funds from my available balance. 

What I want done : 1. Immediate release of the held funds.

2. A clear written explanation of TD Banks funds availability policy and why it was applied to my account in this instance.

3. Assurance that TD Bank will stop the practice of showing funds as available and then later removing them without notice.

08/15/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Unable to open an account,"I opened a business account at TD Bank in New Jersey for XXXX XXXX, which was formed in XX/XX/year> and is automatically in good standing until its first annual report is due. I provided all legally sufficient formation documents, including my XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX confirmation. Despite this, TD Bank is requiring me to purchase a {$52.00} XXXX of XXXX XXXX from the state even though it contains no new information and the bank could verify my status for free through the states public business registry. 

The branch manager confirmed that this is a mandatory back-office requirement and that their hands are tied. This policy appears to be part of a blanket compliance approach, possibly in reaction to past enforcement actions against TD Bank, but it is being applied in situations where it serves no legitimate purpose such as brand-new LLCs that are automatically in good standing. 

Impact to me : As a brand-new small business owner, this extra {$52.00} fee is an unnecessary and avoidable expense when startup costs are already high. 
It delayed my ability to fully use my business bank account and accept payments, creating obstacles in launching my business. 
It sets a precedent that the bank can require costly, redundant paperwork even when legally sufficient documents are already provided making it harder for small businesses to access essential banking services.

Td bank did not ever close the account in which they stated they did. 

On top of that a few months ago I purchased items that were inspected and found out they deemed defective. Opened a dispute with TD Bank they infact opened my dispute incorrectly. They attempted to fix which then opened up another dispute. Then another dispute. Customer service manager said there were over 4 disputes open. My transaction in which I was disputing was handled incorrectly which ended up rendering me responsible for the negative funds in my account. I will not pay these funds. My disputes were not handled correctly the first time which lost my chance at being compensated for my not as described purchases as I was informed that there was only one attempt at this dispute. Which they messed up by opening multiple disputes for the same reason. Then charging the funds to an account that was supposed to be closed. That being said Ive already stopped all attempts to have my funds being protected or have trust in leaving my funds in a TD bank account. 

I submitted appropriate evidence of damages of product.
