The part I'm claiming is that they have all my documentation to verify that I am the owner of the account and additionally to open it they do a verification with security questions that only I know and I passed it without any problem.

10/03/25,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other service problem,None,"I understand that there's security required on specific transactions however on XX/XX/XXXX, I physically presented myself to a TD bank in order to verify myself with my passport ( which I had to drive 3.5 hours to do ) so I would be able to access my online banking profile and send the transfer I needed to. I had to place 11 calls to TD on XX/XX/XXXX with no resolution. They told me my phone number was not valid so I created a new account and purchased a new telephone line to be able to get the text verification to no avail. After speaking with supervisors until I fell asleep last night ( around XXXX XXXX  ) my account was somehow completely suspended at XXXX XXXX. I woke up to this email at XXXX XXXX  and called immediately. Their fraud dept was not open until XXXX XXXX. I called back at XXXX XXXX. They had to submit an additional form for verification. After they approved this unnecessary suspension since I had already presented in person with my passport to prove I'm me and trying to send money to the email, so then I had to wait again until XXXX XXXX  when the hold was lifted since everything checked out. Once that was done, I tried to resend the same amount to the same person and low and behold, another hold on the account. An additional 14 calls today, XX/XX/XXXX!!! Consistent misinformation or lying, poor service and honestly, what seems like discrimination. Oddly a few weeks ago when I was sending money to a very American name, there was absolutely no problem. 

Honestly, there were 2 people out of all 25 calls where the people were helpful, both of those were supervisors. 

Luckily the last person now was able to help push the transaction through after I was very adamant that I was not accepting them brushing me off yet again though she tried. 

I shouldn't have to fight so hard to use my own money how I wish. They cost me hundreds of dollars in my time ( I could not work my job while I was spending hours on the phone with TD ) gas, activating a phone line etc.

I've still escalated to have a manager review the 25 calls and call back which I'm waiting for but I am going to speak to a friend in the legal field to see my recourse options. 

There should be fines for discrimination and there should be regulations around financial institutions and the people that can work there. I keep thinking of what a nightmare this would be for my parent or anyone else who wasn't as forceful as I was. 

Terrible service. Terrible experience. Putting this public so it can warn everyone to stay away from TD. They are far from being convenient as they claim.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,VT,054XX,None,Consent provided,Web,10/03/25,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,16361322
10/08/25,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Fraud or scam,None,"On XX/XX/year>, I received a XXXX message from someone impersonating my father. His XXXX account had been compromised by a scammer, and the messages appeared completely legitimate. Since I regularly help my father with XXXX XXXX, I believed it was truly him and sent {$1400.00} via XXXX to the recipient at XXXX After realizing it was a scam, I contacted TD Bank to report the issue. In my initial panic and confusion, I mistakenly told the bank that the transaction was unauthorized, not fully understanding that the investigation was focused on whether I had physically authorized the transaction on my device rather than on the scammer who misled me. 

I later tried to clarify with TD Bank that I had sent the money myself, but only because I was tricked by someone impersonating my father a clear case of impersonation and social engineering. 

TD Bank denied my claim, stating that XXXX XXXX and a matching IP address were used to complete the transfer, and closed the investigation .. XXXX representative I spoke with was also hostile and dismissive, and I was not provided with clear guidance or support throughout the process. 

I am now requesting that this case be fairly reviewed in light of the full, accurate circumstances.

10/03/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a renewed complaint against TD Bank regarding its discriminatory, inconsistent, and arbitrary treatment of customer cash deposits. This issue is not new. I previously filed CFPB Complaint # XXXX in XXXX, concerning the TD Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ. TD Bank formally responded on XX/XX/XXXX, in a letter from XXXX XXXX, Vice President, Retail Market XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In that letter, TD Bank admitted : XXXX. That my complaint was received and reviewed. 
XXXX. That feedback was shared with the XXXX branch to ensure coaching and consistent customer experience.

3. That TD Bank may require identifying information from any individual conducting cash transactions implying such policy must be clear and applied uniformly, not selectively.

4. That TD Bank is committed to offering products and services in a fair and equitable manner and that inclusivity is a cornerstone of their beliefs.

Despite those assurances, the same misconduct continues, now at another branch. On XX/XX/XXXX, at the XXXX TD Bank XXXX, I attempted to deposit {$6000.00} in cash. The teller insisted on unnecessary identification and seemed confused about the banks own policy. When I questioned this, the assistant XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, became rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. When I said I would escalate the issue to another location, she told me go ahead, I dont care, hes not my boss. 

This proves that TD Bank has not corrected the problem at all. Instead of a one-off issue at XXXX, it is now evident that multiple branches are inconsistently applying so-called internal policies. These thresholds for requesting ID have shifted arbitrarily first {$6500.00}, then {$5000.00}, then {$4000.00}, and now even under {$2000.00}. This is not consistent with federal law, which only requires banks to file Currency Transaction Reports for deposits over {$10000.00} or Suspicious Activity Reports where legitimate red flags exist.

This selective and inconsistent treatment raises serious concerns of discrimination, harassment, and profiling. I am a XXXX individual with a bad back, and a retired XXXX  XXXX. Forcing me to repeatedly wait XXXX minutes in a drive-thru, treating me as though I am engaged in criminal conduct, and refusing to provide a clear, written explanation of policy is unacceptable and unlawful. 

Federal and state law provide protection in this context : The Americans with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) requires equal and accessible service without unnecessary barriers. 
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( XXXX ) prohibits discrimination in banking services. 
The XXXX XXXX XXXX ( FHA ) prohibits discrimination in financial services related to housing. 
The New Jersey XXXX XXXX Discrimination ( NJLAD ) prohibits discriminatory practices in places of public accommodation, including banks. 

TD Banks failure to correct this conduct, even after a prior CFPB complaint and a written commitment in XXXX, shows a troubling pattern of disregard for both customers and regulatory obligations. 

I am demanding that TD Bank : XXXX. Provide its actual written, bank-wide policy on cash deposit identification requirements. 
XXXX. Ensure that the policy is applied consistently and uniformly at all branches. 
XXXX. Retrain or discipline staff who apply selective or arbitrary rules. 
XXXX. Address the unprofessional behavior of XXXX assistant XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

If this matter is not resolved, I will escalate this again to the CFPB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( XXXX ), the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX violations, and the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights.

10/09/25,Credit card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing to filed a formal consumer complaint against Nordstrom and TD bank ( issue my Nordstrom Card ending XXXX ) Regarding a charged of XXXX $ for merchandise I never received.

However, I never received the merchandise, and it was subsequently lost or stolen. 
I did filed Police report on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX at XXXX my case report is XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX. 

Despite providing Nordstrom and TD bank with this, including the delivery photo and my claim with XXXX, both entities have refused to remove or refund the charge. Nordstrom insists I claim my homeowners insurance, and TD Bank denied my dispute citing the delivery photo as proof of delivery. 

Please note that under the Fair Credit billing act, I am entitled to dispute charges for good I not received, and I request that any collection or adverse credit reporting on this balance be suspended until dispute is resolved. 

Noted, I have been emailed to disputesuppote @ nordstom ( many time ) to follow up and willing to get this issue resolved with my RIGHT and FAIRNESS. 

But, ( Nordstrom merchant, Nordstrom Credit card, XXXX  ) got all denial and refused to help with my request, All matter from them I only got a word There is nothing I can do with it. 

To Nordstrom Merchant And Nordstrom Credit card, XXXX XXXX I understand your position, However, I must respectfully disagree with your conclusion. The merchandise in question was never received and the delivery photo clearly shown its was left unattended- which dose not constitute valid proof of delivery under the Fair Credit Billing Act. 
As a paying customer, I fulfilled my obligation by purchasing and paying for the item. The responsibility for ensuring safe and verified delivery rests with merchant and its chosen carrier, Not the consumer.

I am continuing to pursue this matter through the appropriate regulatory channels and expect a fair resolution in accordance with federal consumer protection laws.

10/02/25,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"To Whom It May Concern, around XX/XX/year>, I was the victim of a XXXX  scam initiated through the housing website Furnished Finder. An individual identifying herself as XXXX posed as a prospective roommate and claimed her father would send me funds for move-in expenses. I later received a check for {$6500.00} made out to me, allegedly from XXXX XXXX. 
Before depositing the check, I went to a TD Bank branch and specifically asked an employee to confirm its legitimacy. The TD Bank representative assured me it was a valid check and pressured me to deposit it, stating I had to deposit it. Based on this assurance, I relied on TD Banks expertise and deposited the check. The funds appeared to clear in my account. 
Soon after, XXXX and others posing as her father and dealership staff pressured me into sending money for car delivery services. Believing the check was genuine and trusting TD Banks confirmation, I sent {$1000.00} via XXXX to the contact information provided to "" XXXX XXXX. '' The following day, TD Bank notified me the check was fraudulent. By then, the scammer had vanished and ceased all communication. When I returned to TD Bank for assistance, I was met with complete indifference. TD Bank refused to help, denied my claim, and placed the entire burden of their employees misrepresentation and negligence on me. 
This stands in stark contrast to my experience at XXXX Bank, where staff immediately identified the check as fake when I showed it to them. TD Bank not only failed to protect me, but they actively misled me into depositing a fraudulent check. Their failure directly caused me to lose {$1000.00}. 
I also filed a police report documenting the scam, underscoring the seriousness of this matter. 
TD Banks conduct demonstrates a complete failure of consumer protection and due diligence. I am requesting that TD Bank be held accountable and required to reimburse me the {$1000.00} lost as a result of their negligence, failure to properly identify a fraudulent instrument, and refusal to assist me after the fraud was discovered.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NY,105XX,None,Consent provided,Web,10/02/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16312824

10/08/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I am filing this complaint against TD Auto Finance for continued inaccurate and inconsistent credit reporting on my auto loan account, even after it was charged off. 

The company appears to have recently modified and re-aged the account. My previous report ( as of XX/XX/year> ) showed : Account charged off. {$20000.00} written off. {$20000.00} past due as of XX/XX/year>. 
Balance updated : XX/XX/year>. 

However, the same account was later changed to show : Account charged off. {$20000.00} written off. {$20000.00} past due as of XX/XX/year>. 
Balance updated : XX/XX/year>. 

There have been no payments or new activity since the charge-off in XX/XX/year>, so these updates are improper. Once an account is charged off, the balance and as of dates should remain fixed unless the consumer makes a payment. TD Auto Finance continues to update the balance monthly as if the account were still active, which is inaccurate and misleading.

This practice may violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and 623 ( a ) ( 5 ) ), which require furnishers to report complete and accurate information and prohibit re-aging of delinquent accounts. It also conflicts with Metro 2 reporting standards, which state that a charged-off account should reflect a static charge-off date and not report ongoing past due balances. 

I am requesting that the CFPB investigate TD Auto Finances credit reporting practices for this account and ensure the furnisher provides : The verified Date of First Delinquency ( DOFD ) The correct charge-off date An accurate, non-re-aged balance that reflects the final charge-off amount only TD Auto Finances continued updates after charge-off cause the account to appear more recent and more negative than it truly is, unfairly damaging my credit standing.

On XX/XX/year>, at XXXXXXXX XXXX, I contacted TD Bank to report that my card had been stolen. During this call, the agent was unable to record my phone number and failed to properly document that my card was indeed stolen. This lack of proper procedure and attention to detail is concerning, as it puts my account security at risk. 

I expect financial institutions to have robust protocols in place for handling such serious matters, and I am disappointed with the service I received. This situation has left me feeling vulnerable and unsupported. 

I request your assistance in ensuring that TD Bank addresses this issue and improves their customer service protocols to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

09/28/25,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"I had purchased my loan to the dealership in XX/XX/XXXX and the only payment that would accept my down payment of {$3000.00} was TD auto finance. I financed a XXXX XXXX XXXX that was used. They charged me {$35000.00}. 

I had set up auto pay so I dont have to think about paying the bill however their system processes payments very slow and it could take up to XXXX days in which there has been times that the bill overlaps with another bill and then cant process the payment I have to call the customer service desk to manually make a payment if that happens and XXXX of the ladies said that Im close to having my car repossessed that was around XXXX I had financial hardship because of a workplace injury and another workplace job being affected with my income and so the only thing that they would do for me is give me a month where I only have to pay I think around {$250.00} but then the rest would go back towards the interest ( 8.09 % ) They ended up removing the privilege to automatically pay because of this bill overlap. However, when you call the customer support to manually pay over the phone a process the payment instantly and within XX/XX/XXXX, I have the payment deducted from my account. 

I feel like I am being overcharged for the XXXX and they say that it is premium on the title and on the VIN, but there are definitely a lot of features that arent there that would be considered premium. For example, I have a regular key. I dont have a sunroof. I dont have the camera eyesight and other features. 

If I go and sell this car on the market today, it will be probably around for {$8000.00} to someone. 

I just think its not fair that I have to manually call to pay my bill and online. It was made easy to pay your bill in different payment amounts rather than just the minimum payment. 

I am not sure how to make more than the minimum payment through the phone service. 

There has been hardships constantly happening, whether it was from the XXXX, whether it was from the workplace injury, whether it was a sudden loss of a job. 

I strongly believe that the interest payment is ridiculously high. I think that the amount of finance is really high too. Consider considering that I have not been able to access the online portal since XXXX I find it faulty in their system that theyre processing takes XXXX days over auto pay, but if you miss auto pay, they can apparently repossess your car. 

I also had not known about certain defects like the passenger inside door handle, not completely latching, causing the door to open on the passenger. The airbag system, for some reason it stays off. There has been for some reason, hoses blowing, and motor oil getting into the radiator. 

Also, my windshield cracked for no reason there was no rock or anything like that and the reason why I mentioning this is because there are potential recalls for aXX/XX/XXXXvalve and there has been previous recalls on other window panels that crack. The XX/XX/XXXX issue also includes a sudden loss of power in which a lot of these recalls dont appear on XXXX website. I know that thats a different measure than when were talking about TD auto finance itself. 

If I knew that a brand new car would have actually given me a lower interest probably around 4 % I wouldve just financed a new car at the XXXX dealership that I purchased this one. I have called their customer service to try to negotiate stuff however it doesnt seem like they arent willing to do much other than what I had stated before about them waving a month, but actually charging you and then applying the balance to your interest. 

I feel stuck on minimum payments at a high rate with a car that was overvalued and not having all the bells and whistles as what the title states it should be.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NV,89509,None,Consent provided,Web,09/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16225356

10/02/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Problem with balance transfer,"I am writing to report what I believe to be an unfair, non-transparent, and harmful practice on the part of TD Bank.

In XX/XX/year>, I applied for and was approved for a TD Bank cash credit card with a balance transfer offer. However, due to a lack of transparency in the way the promotion was presented, I was unable to determine the exact expiration date of the 0 % balance transfer APR offer. 

On XX/XX/year>, TD Bank charged me {$65.00} in interest. I immediately paid off the transferred balance in full, and the payment posted on XX/XX/year>. I contacted TD Bank several times to request that the interest charges be reversed, but I was told there was nothing they could do since the payment was posted after the promotional period had expired. 

Most credit card issuers clearly disclose the expiration date of promotional offers, send reminders as the expiration date approaches, and in some cases provide a short grace period to allow customers to resolve any balance before interest is charged. TD Bank did none of these things. Their refusal to reverse the chargeseven though the balance was fully paid off within daysstrikes me as not only harmful to consumers but also a predatory business practice.

I am therefore requesting that your office review this matter and determine whether TD Banks practices comply with consumer protection standards.

The same Target/TD account is reported differently across all three credit bureaus : XXXX  : XXXX, {$540.00} balance, 120 days late, not disputed. 

XXXX  : Closed, charged off, {$590.00} balance, not disputed. 

XXXX  : Open, disputed, {$540.00} balance. 

These contradictions violate FCRA 1681e ( b ) ( accuracy requirement ), 1681s-2 ( a ) ( furnisher accuracy ), and 1681i ( reinvestigation ). XXXX  shows an active dispute, yet XXXX  and XXXX  do not violating FDCPA 807 ( 8 ) and FCRA 623 ( b ), which require furnishers to report disputed accounts consistently to all CRAs. 

This inaccurate and conflicting reporting has negatively impacted my credit profile. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate Target/TD Banks reporting practices, require deletion or correction of unverifiable data, and ensure compliance with the FCRA and FDCPA. 

Requested Resolution : Deletion of the inaccurate information from all CRAs. 

Confirmation of dispute handling procedures and reinvestigation results.

10/08/25,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"On XXXX I received an email from my landlord that they received a check from the same TD Bank account whose check bounced last month thus incurring a fee for me. The TD branch managers XX/XX/XXXX letter states that the account is being closed and that checks received after XXXX will be returned. I was advised to discontinue writing additional checks but I stopped writing checks long ago. The only checks sent from my account was an automatic bill pay that the bank itself sends. Despite their own letter stating not to send checks after XXXX, TD continues to send rent checks from my closed account apparently in retaliation for my negative online reviews. They sent a check in XXXX which bounced and incurred a fee. I complained to both state and federal regulators about this XXXX XXXX which prompted a response from TD stating they would refund me the fee and had stopped sending rent checks as of XXXX. However, they then sent a rent check to my landlord in XXXX. Also, I have yet to receive their promised refund from sending the bounced XXXX check. Im tired of their lies. They need to stop sending checks from an account that has been closed for months and accept that my negative online reviews ( which I am updating for this ) are not coming down despite their continued harassment. 
Earlier complaint : In retaliation for my online XXXX negative review caused by TD telling me they sent my XXXX XXXX XXXX. to the wrong email address when I opened a CD ( the rep kept repeating the wrong address, adding an extra m ), I received a letter from TD stating that they were giving me 15 days notice that they were closing my checking account even though my review posted online three days earlier said I'd be closing it and moving to XXXX. However, the letter was sent on XX/XX/XXXX which is after it is dated. Therefore, I did not receive the notice they claimed and filed a complaint with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX about that and about being unable to close my CD. The subject of the letter from TD was my checking account and the letter stated that account alone would be closed XXXX which did not afford the 15 day notice claimed. In the meantime, I closed my savings account but was told I could not close my CD without incurring a large penalty even though I had just opened it the prior day. XXXX XXXX from TD responded to my complaint in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which, like the last one, was sent after it was dated. It was not received by me until XX/XX/XXXX. In it he said my accounts ( plural ) would be closed out on XX/XX/XXXX and I would not be charged an early closeout penalty on the CD. Since the letter was received after the XXXX deadline, it was too late as I had already closed both the checking account and CD which included interest and no penalty despite my being told on XX/XX/XXXX that TD would not allow that. Today I received an email from my landlord that the attached check dated XXXX was mailed to them by TD and bounced thus incurring a {$35.00} fee for me. TD sent the check despite closing the account last month, knowing full well that this would cost me a fee. I request that the Board demand that TD Bank cease sending checks from my closed account immediately and reimburse me the bounced check fee. I dont believe that this type of continued harassment after my account closure, and after the gaslighting I experienced at the branch and in their response to my complaint which included absurd allegations, would be happening if I werent a XXXX, XXXX XXXX who wrote a critical online review of the branch after their rep told me they sent my personal info to the wrong email address.

4. A complete record of all payments made and how they were applied.

5. Proof that you are licensed and authorized to collect debts in my state.

While they were assembling the wooden frame planks, they did not appear evenly distributed, but I figured that they were experts and that they knew what they were doing. 

When they left, I noticed that the nightstand did not lay flat on the floor. 

I sent my salesperson a text letting her know that the nightstand did not lay flat but that I did not notice it until after they had already left my home. I have copies of texts and plenty of photos. 

I called the number and left a message ; no one ever called me back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX : I sent another text to XXXX me and she said she would contact customer care. 

I also noticed that the frame was very squeaky when I sat on the bed. I also noticed that there were strings hanging from the mattress which made me feel like the mattress was not new. 
The bed frame eventually broke in half and fell. 

It was weeks before a repairman came out to fix the bed. When the man did come, he said he could not understand why he was sent out. He said this bed can not be repaired. Then he said the nightstand was wobbly because my floor was not even which is a lie. 

It has been well over a month since the repairman said that they would take care of the problem. I have heard nothing from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I was getting ready to make the final {$1200.00} payment when my daughter said to me, XXXX they are taking advantage of you. You are elderly, frail, and you have XXXX XXXX, and your problems leave you little energy to fight this, but why are you paying for something that you do not and can not use! I have been sleeping on my sofa because I am afraid to hurt myself on a broken bed.

I notified the bank of the fraud within the XXXX window required under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E.

I was unable to replace the card immediately because I was out of town for work and had no access to a secure mailing address. I explained this to the bank, but they still refused the refund.

This is a violation of EFTA protections.

You have been provided with overwhelming proof that this account was the product of identity theft, yet you persist in furnishing false and damaging information to the credit bureaus. Your actions represent blatant violations of multiple federal and state consumer protection laws, including but not limited to : FCRA 623 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ) : You are prohibited from furnishing information you know, or should know, is inaccurate. Your continued reporting after repeated disputes, FTC reports, and attorney contact makes this willful noncompliance. FCRA 605B & 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) : You are legally required to block identity theft-related information and are barred from reinsertion without proper certification and consumer notice. FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) : By treating this account as valid, you are attempting to collect on a debt not owed, which is unlawful. FCCPA ( Fla. Stat. 559.72 ) : If applicable, you are prohibited from willfully communicating false credit information. My attorney has already reached out regarding this matter.

10/08/25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Difficulty submitting a dispute or getting information about a dispute over the phone,"I was in the process of doing a refinance and having the new lender payoff my TD Bank Home Equity Loan along with my first mortgage. TD Bank was aware that I was in the process of a refinance as XXXX had been in contact with them several times to obtain payoff figures. When I was asked by XXXX to call TD Bank and assist in getting a payoff number, the TD Bank person I spoke to asked me if I was going to make a payment and I told her that since I was doing the refinance I wasn't going to make a payment. She said, okay. All of a sudden I get a call last week from TD that my payment was late and I said I knew and I was in the process of this refinance and that person indicated that I had been reported to the credit bureau. I immediately made the payment, but I had already been reported to the bureaus. I was very upset and asked them why didn't they give me the courtesy of letting me know that I was going to be reported to the credit bureau since they knew I was about to close on the new refinance. I explained to them that the woman I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX, did not inform me to make a payment. She asked me if I was going to make the payment and I indicated to her that I wasn't due to the pending refinance. She never suggested or indicated that if I didn't make the payment, they would report me to the credit bureau. This is what I have told several TD Bank supervisors in the last week. Why couldn't they have been upfront at the time I asked for the payoff and simply tell me that I should make the payment or they would report me? This has caused me a lot of issues with me obtaining the refinance. I paid them the past due amount last week and they are not willing to report the update to the bureau, and they indicated they were going to listen to the recorded call from XX/XX/XXXX and today they indicated that they listened to the call and that the representative suggested that I make a payment. Of course, I didn't record the call, but I've learned a hard lesson whenever I speak to a bank again, I will record the call myself. I told them that I told the lady from TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX that I was not going to make the payment and she said okay. She NEVER INDICATED THAT IF I DIDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENT THEY WOULD REPORT ME TO THE CREDIT BUREAUS. I told them I want to file a complaint with the chairman and they took the information over the phone today and said they would be in contact in XXXX to XXXX days. They had promised to call me back this past Monday and they finally called me today to discuss the call of XX/XX/XXXX. I asked them to report to the bureau that the account is up to date and they are not willing to do so until I pay the XXXX payment which isn't due yet. I also asked them if they could take away the late reporting since this is now critically affecting the possibility of me obtaining a refinance on my home.

10/01/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I am submitting this formal complaint to document Targets ongoing failure to properly investigate and remove fraudulent charges on my Target credit card account, despite my full compliance with federal fraud reporting requirements. My card was stolen and used without authorization, resulting in fraudulent charges at XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$560.00} and XXXX for {$110.00} on XX/XX/year>, totaling {$730.00}. Immediately after discovering this theft, I filed an FTC Identity Theft Reportwhich is legally sufficient as a police reportand submitted a fraud affidavit. Target has had all the information necessary to resolve this matter, yet these charges remain on my account, I continue to receive billing statements demanding payment, and no provisional credits have been issued. 

Targets actions are in direct violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ), which requires creditors to promptly remove or provisionally credit fraudulent charges once reported. Instead, Target has refused to accept legally sufficient documentation, has ignored the FTC report and affidavit, and has placed the burden on me to complete and mail a questionnaire that I never received. Even when I requested alternative ways to provide this information, Target insisted on outdated procedures such as fax or postal mail, all while continuing to demand payment. This is unreasonable, unnecessary, and unacceptable. 

As the issuing bank, TD Bank has a responsibility to ensure compliance with the FCBA and XXXX rules. By failing to intervene and correct Targets mishandling of this claim, TD Bank has allowed this situation to persist, placing me at risk of further financial harm and damage to my credit. XXXX, in turn, is responsible for overseeing compliance among its participating banks and merchants. By permitting both Target and TD Bank to disregard proper fraud protocols, XXXX is failing to uphold its obligations to cardholders. 

I therefore demand immediate removal of all fraudulent charges, issuance of provisional credits, written confirmation that I am not liable for this debt, and assurance that no negative credit reporting will occur as a result of Targets failure to act. If these actions are not taken without delay, I will escalate this matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, state and federal regulators, and I will pursue legal action against Target and TD Bank for violations of the FCBA and consumer protection laws.

The charges were for the following amounts : {$360.00} {$57.00} {$57.00} At no point did I authorize these transactions, and I was in full possession of my debit card the entire time. I did not notice the fraudulent activity until I returned home from my trip. 

As soon as I became aware, I contacted TD Bank to report the fraud. They stated they would investigate the claim and provided a provisional credit in the meantime while the investigation was ongoing. 

After several months with no resolution, TD Bank reversed the provisional credit, bringing my account into a negative balance. I called the bank to express my frustration and requested that the case be reopened for reinvestigation, as the claim had been denied. 

When the bank denied my claim again, I filed an official police report with the XXXX XXXX Police Department to further support my case. The report number is XXXX, and I promptly submitted this to TD Bank. 

Shockingly, less than XXXX hours after submitting the police report, TD Bank denied my claim for a third time, despite this new evidence. I feel the bank failed to perform a proper or thorough investigation and is not taking fraud protection seriously.

10/05/25,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I am reopening this issue under a new complaint because my previous CFPB case ( # XXXX ) was closed without a fair or lawful resolution. TD Bank denied my fraud dispute three separate times, claiming that the transactions appeared authorized because there were successful online logins and no aggressive spending. These reasons are irrelevant and do not meet the legal standards for determining authorization under federal law. 
I did not authorize or benefit from any of the disputed transactions totaling {$1700.00}. I only discovered the card had been stolen after receiving an unexpected paper statementsomething I normally do not receive by mail. I immediately reported the loss and the unauthorized transactions to TD Bank, yet my claim was denied without a proper investigation.

TD Banks response failed to follow the requirements of Regulation Z ( 12 CFR 1026.13 ) and the Fair Credit Billing Act, which protect consumers from liability for unauthorized credit-card use. The bank never provided proof that I authorized these charges, and its reasoning relied entirely on speculative assumptions. Online logins can not be used as evidence of cardholder consent, and the pattern of spending is irrelevant to determining fraud. 
I provided timely notice, cooperated fully, and even filed an official CFPB complaint, yet TD Bank sustained its denial without addressing the facts. The prior case was marked closed even though the matter remains unresolved and the bank continues to hold me responsible for fraudulent charges. 
I respectfully request that the CFPB reopen this issue as a new case, review TD Banks inadequate investigation, and ensure compliance with federal consumer-protection laws. I seek a full refund of {$1700.00} in unauthorized charges and confirmation that I will not be held liable for any fraudulent balance.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NJ,07024,None,Consent provided,Web,10/05/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,16377662

He said his company deemed my XXXX payment as high risk for fraud and that's why he thinks it was terminated. I called TD bank and informed them of everything that happened and started a claim on Thursday the XXXX. I spoke with TD on Tuesday the XXXX and my claim was closed because additional information requested wasn't submitted. I informed the rep that no one told me I had to submit anything. The rep informed me that someone from the fraud department reached out to me. I located the number that called me, and remember getting the call. I didn't pick up the call because the number didn't lead back to TD and when I called the number back it was a personal answering machine. So i put the number on my spam list. Again, I even googled the number. The rep informed me that was them asking for documents.

However, upon reviewing my credit report, I discover several instances of late payments recorded by these creditors. Perplexed by this discrepancy, I contacted these creditors to inquire about the inaccuracies. After discussing the matter with a customer service representative and the billing department, it becomes evident that there was a mutual agreement between me and these creditors to adjust the payment schedule due to unforeseen circumstances. Despite adhering to this adjusted schedule, the payments were mistakenly marked as late in the system. Understanding the gravity of the situation, these creditors swiftly acknowledge the error and assures me that the inaccurate late payments will be rectified.
